            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>PHy≈øick, both upon the account of its object, and the nece≈ø≈øity of it, is a mo≈øt Noble Art.</p>
               <p>It wholly con≈øi≈øts of Practice; for all the parts of it are directed to Healing: And therefore it is an Art, and not a Science; the end whereof is Contemplation: And con≈øequently, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øes that are made up of Hypothe≈øes, or Suppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, belong rather to Phylo≈øophy than Phy≈øick.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63575:10"/>
               <p>But it mu≈øt be acknowledged, that there are ≈øome Di≈øea≈øes incurable, therefore out of the reach of Phy≈øick; yet it is nece≈ø≈øary to treat of them, that they may be known as ≈øuch, and foretold, that the Art may not be di≈øgraced.</p>

               <p>It is commonly divided into five parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiology, that Treats of Natural Things: Hygiene, that Treats of Things non-natural, or Things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for the pre≈øervation of Health; but yet ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hurting it: Pathology, that Treats of Things contrary to Nature: Semeiotice, that ≈øhews the Signs of Things contrary to Nature: Therapeutice, that Treats of the general way of Cure, by Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, Pharmacy, and Diet.</p>
               <p>But Phy≈øiology does not properly belong to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick, and therefore ought not to be accounted a part of it; yet becau≈øe it is u≈øually propo≈øed in Treati≈øes of this kind, I will briefly do ≈øo.</p>
               <p>Things that are called Natural are ≈øeven, <hi>viz.</hi> Elements, Temperaments, Humours, Spirits, Parts, Faculties, Actions; and among the≈øe, are to be reckoned ≈øome other things which are treated of in Phy≈øiology, as Age, Sex, and the like.</p>
               <p>Elements are the mo≈øt Simple Bodies, of which all other Bodies are fir≈øt compo≈øed, and at la≈øt di≈ø≈øolved. The union or conjunction of the Elements in the Body is called mixture; and a Body made up of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is called mixed.</p>
               <p>The Elements are Four, <hi>viz.</hi> Earth, Water, Air and Fire. The Chymi≈øts add Salt, Sulphur, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63575:10"/>Mercury, tho' improperly; for in ≈øome Bodies, for in≈øtance, Gold, burnt Talc, Gla≈øs, you cannot find either of the three; and in other mixt Bodies you may find more, as in the Humane Blood, Flegm, Salt, Oyl, Spirit and Earth; and if we ≈øhould allow that Salt, Sulphur and Mercury may be drawn from ≈øome Bodies by the force of the Fire, it does not therefore follow, that they were in them before as fir≈øt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for perhaps they were produced in them by the Fire: Moreover, they are not perfectly Simple Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Temperament in general, is a convenient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elements among them≈øelves, or is a ≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical proportion of the Qualities.</p>
               <p>A Quality is a certain di≈øpo≈øition of in≈øen≈øible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, con≈øtituting ≈øen≈øible Parts; it is divided into Fir≈øt and Second. The≈øe Four are called the fir≈øt, Heat, Cold, Moi≈øture, Dryne≈øs; and that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the re≈øt, denominates the Temperament.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt Quality among Phy≈øicians is termed Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Potential; Actual, which is perceived im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by touching, as Heat in Fire, Coldne≈øs in Water, and the like. It's ≈øaid Potential, when it is not immediately perceived by touching, as Heat in Pepper, Coldne≈øs in Lettice.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond Qualities are Colours, Sounds, Smells, Ta≈øts, Gravity, Levity, Hardne≈øs, Softne≈øs, Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Roughne≈øs, Rarity, Den≈øity, and the like.</p>
               <p>An equal Temperament with re≈øpect to weight, con≈øi≈øts in an exact mixture of all the fir≈øt Qualities. An equal Temperament with re≈øpect to Ju≈øtice, as they term it, is improperly called equal; for it's ≈øuch a proportion of the fir≈øt Qualities as the Nature of the Mixture requires, whether they are in an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or not.</p>
               <p>Temperament is divided into Partial and Total. A Partial Temperament is that which is allotted to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63575:11"/>every part; as the temperament of the Brain, Heart, or the like. A Temperament that is called Total is a≈øcribed to the whole Mixture, and is made up of ≈øuch as are partial, as the Temperament of this or that Man.</p>
               <p>Temperament is al≈øo divided into innate and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. The innate Temperament is that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally belongs to a Man; the acquired is that which comes in the cour≈øe of years, by rea≈øon of things non-natural, or contrary to Nature.</p>
               <p>All the Parts of the Body, according to them≈øelves are hot and moi≈øt; yet with re≈øpect one to another, ≈øome are ≈øaid to be hot, cold, moi≈øt and dry. The Heart, Blood, Spirits, Arteries, Veins, Lungs, Spleen, Liver, are counted hot; but the Heart is reckoned the hotte≈øt.</p>
               <p>Parts that are counted Cold, are the Bones, Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Tendons, Membranes, Ligaments, Spinal Marrow, and the like.</p>
               <p>The moi≈øt parts, are the Blood and other Humours, the Brain, and Spinal Marrow.</p>
               <p>The dry parts are the Bones, the Cartilages, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, Ligaments, Heart, Lungs, Nails, Hair.</p>
               <p>The ≈øigns of a hot and dry Temperament of the whole, are a quick and hard Pul≈øe, a dry habit of the Body, a brown Complexion, cri≈øped Hair, of a brown or black Colour; for Heat feeds on the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture of the Body, melts the Fat, and drys up the Humours. The Appetite and Dige≈øtion are ≈ømall, there is a pronene≈øs to Anger, the Sleep is ≈øhort and di≈øturbed by rea≈øon of the heat of the Spirits; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery is exce≈ø≈øive, by rea≈øon of the Acrimony of the Seed; the Wit is Sharp, and the Body Active, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Spirits are pure. The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ≈øo Con≈øtituted.</p>
               <p>The ≈øigns of an hot and moi≈øt Temperament, are a large Pul≈øe, but not frequent nor hard; a Fat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63575:11"/>of the Body, but not very Fat; becau≈øe that proceeds from Frigidity and Moi≈øture. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion is florid and clear; the Hairs are ≈øometimes curled, and ≈øometimes not, and not very Black; the Appetite and Dige≈øtion are pretty good; the Sleep moderate and quiet, the Mind chearful; and Venery moderate.</p>
               <p>The ≈øigns of a Cold and Moi≈øt Temperament are, a ≈ømall and ≈øoft Pul≈øe, a white and ≈ømooth Skin, a ≈øoft and fat habit of Body, the Hair Yellow, and mo≈øt commonly ≈øtrait, the Appetite great, and the Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion good; the Sleep very much, a drow≈øie Di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Wit ≈ømall, an unfitne≈øs for Motion, Venery ≈ømall. And this is the Temperament of mo≈øt of the <hi>Northern</hi> People.</p>
               <p>The ≈øigns of a Cold and Dry Temperament are, a ≈ømall Pul≈øe, and ≈øomewhat hard; the Skin ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rough, the habit of the Body dry, the Hair thin, Appetite and Dige≈øtion ≈ømall, Sleep ≈øhorter than in the Cold and Moi≈øt Temperament, little or no inclination to Venery.</p>
               <p>But it is to be noted, that you mu≈øt not expect all the≈øe ≈øigns preci≈øely in the≈øe four Temperaments, yet there ought to be mo≈øt of them; and according to the number of them, you mu≈øt judge of the exce≈øs in this or that Quality.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II. </hi>Of the Sexes, Ages, and the various Temperaments of them.</head>
               <p>ACcording to the diver≈øity of Sex and Age, the Temperament is al≈øo divers.</p>
               <p>Sexes differ according to the different Conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Temper of the Genital Parts.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63575:12"/>
               <p>Sex is twofold, Ma≈øculine and Feminine. The former is mo≈øt commonly hotter than the latter; which appears <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> by the Pul≈øe, that are larger and more frequent, by the habit of the Body, which is dryer, by the greater firmne≈øs of the Parts, by the Actions that are ≈øtronger and more perfect, by a greater di≈øpo≈øition to a Fever, and a le≈øs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Crudities; all which, as they proceed from a greater heat, ≈øo they vindicate it. Nor does Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens growing ≈øooner, contradict what has bin ≈øaid, becau≈øe this is rather to be a≈øcribed to the ≈øoftne≈øs and ductility of the Parts, than to Heat: Nor would it make any thing again≈øt us, if we ≈øhould grant they have more Blood than Men; for if it ≈øhould be ≈øo, it would not follow that they generate more Blood; but that they do not con≈øume ≈øo much. They being more ≈øalacious, and more prone to Anger, proves nothing; for one may come from their Pride, and the other from the weakne≈øs of their Minds; tho' we confe≈øs that ≈øome Viragoes may be hotter than Men.</p>
               <p>Age is the various ≈øea≈øons of Humane Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ≈øome notable change is ob≈øerved. They are eight: <hi>Infancy,</hi> which continues to the third year. <hi>Childhood,</hi> from the third to the tenth. <hi>Puberty,</hi> from the tenth to the eighteenth year. <hi>Adole≈øcency,</hi> from the eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth to the twenty fifth. <hi>Juvenility,</hi> from the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth to the thirty fifth. <hi>Virility,</hi> from the thirty fifth to the fiftieth. <hi>Old Age,</hi> from the fiftieth to the ≈øixty fifth: <hi>Decrepid Age</hi> takes up all the re≈øt of the time of Life.</p>
               <p>The Cau≈øes of Ages is the divers proportion of the Native Heat, at this or that time of Life, by rea≈øon of natural things, or things preternatural; ≈øo that the Ages in all are not circum≈øcribed within the ≈øaid terms of years; but they happen in ≈øome ≈øooner, in ≈øome later; and ≈øome grow Old ≈øooner than others.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63575:12"/>
               <p>Infancy is the mo≈øt Moi≈øt of all, which appears plainly from the flexibility and ≈øoftne≈øs of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; all other Ages, the farther they recede from Infancy, the dryer they are. But it is not the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt of all; for the greate≈øt heat would not ≈øuit with moi≈øture; for it would either di≈ø≈øipate it, or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh it. Heat therefore increa≈øes till Virility, and then it is at its height; for the habit of the Body, by continual action of the Heat, is dryed, and pre≈ø≈øes the mouths of the Arteries, and makes them narrower; ≈øo that on this account the thicker part of the Blood is kept from the Parts which it ought to moi≈øten; the Sero≈øities are not purged off, but are daily kept up more and more in the Ve≈ø≈øels, they ≈øuppre≈øs the Fire of the Heart, and at la≈øt extingui≈øh it. The abundance of this unconcocted Humidity is the cau≈øe of Hoarine≈øs in Old Men; and their Baldne≈øs ari≈øes from the defect of the matter of Hairs; which is a fat Vapour, or at lea≈øt, becau≈øe ≈øuch a Vapour does not come to the Hairs, by rea≈øon of a con≈øtriction of the Pores. But in the mean while, we mu≈øt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that Old Men are moi≈øte≈øt; for their Blood does not penetrate and moi≈øten the parts of the Body, tho upon the account of the Excrements that are put off upon certain parts of the Body, as the No≈øtrils, Eyes, and the like, they may ≈øeem mo≈øt moi≈øt.</p>
               <p>From what has bin ≈øaid it appears, that the next cau≈øe of Death in Old Men, is too great a Sero≈øity of the Blood; but the dryne≈øs of the Body is the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cau≈øe, and want of Heat the mo≈øt remote; and therefore Old Men are be≈øt pre≈øerved by hot and dry things, as with Wine, and the Spirits of it, and the like; which revive the languid Heat, and dry up the Sero≈øities.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III. </hi>Of the Native Heat.</head>
               <p>IT may not be incongruous to add ≈øomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Natural Heat to the Temperaments; according to the variation whereof, the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment varies much.</p>
               <p>The Natural Heat is nothing el≈øe but a quick and confu≈øed Motion of a ≈øubtile Matter, or certain Fire that is not Lucid, ≈øuch as we perceive in Lime when it is ≈øprinkled with Water, in ≈øeveral Chymical Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, in Hor≈øe-dung, and in Herbs heapt up together and putrifying; yet is it hot, and differs only from our common Fire in degree. This moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ari≈øes hence, <hi>viz.</hi> becau≈øe a ≈øubtile Matter in≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating it ≈øelf into the Blood, cannot move freely in it, and therefore is forced to exert its power upon the Particles of the Blood, and to agitate them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øedly; ≈øo that it has the ≈øame Cau≈øes with Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and therefore we may well think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from it.</p>
               <p>Fermentation is an inte≈øtine Motion among the heterogeneous Parts of any Body, whereby that in ≈øome ≈øort, is rarified and fired. It is effected in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> A ≈øubtile Matter pa≈ø≈øing through ≈øome humid and fluid Bodies, meets with rigid Particles which are not very flexible, which ≈øwim in them, and becau≈øe they cannot accommodate them≈øelves to the Pores, occa≈øion a Confu≈øion; ≈øo that then the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Matter in≈øinuates it ≈øelf in a large quantity to fill the Pores, and ≈øo it rarifies the ≈øaid Bodies; as more Men, for in≈øtance, can be contained in a Room, when they are quiet and lie ≈øtill, than when they move di≈øorderly; this is every where ≈øeen in humid Bodies,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63575:13"/>as Wine that is quiet all the Winter, will Ferment ≈øo much in the Spring, as to break the Ve≈ø≈øel if there be no Vent, the ≈øubtile Matter being put into a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the approach of the Sun. But all Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Liquor is not properly Fermentation, but only that which is from an inte≈øtine Principle, or an Heterogeneity of Parts, and a diver≈øity of the Pores, by rea≈øon whereof the pa≈ø≈øage for the ≈øubtile Matter is rendered more difficult, and con≈øequently there is no Fermentation in Water, or in another Liquor more homogeneous, rarifying over a Fire; for it boils up only by being forced by a great quantity of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Matter from abroad, and not from any internal Cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>The Natural Heat, or ≈øubtile Matter, re≈øides in the Ventricles of the Heart, e≈øpecially in the Left, and rarifies the Blood as it pa≈ø≈øes by. It is kept up by a ≈øubtile Matter, which is continually brought to the Heart, from the Nouri≈øhment, Chyle, and Blood.</p>
               <p>We are hotter in Summer than in Winter; for our Pul≈øe are then quicker and ≈øtronger; our Thir≈øt is greater, and we then more de≈øire Cold Things, and Dige≈øt them without offence, and are injured by Hot Things, and are prone to Fevers; and we perceive no ≈øhaking or ≈øhivering after Meals, as in the Winter. We are Colder in the Winter, becau≈øe a ≈øerous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour abounds then in the Blood, by rea≈øon Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiration is le≈øs, and the Fire of the Heart is le≈ø≈øen'd by the Cold Air that is breathed in; but the Dige≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is be≈øt in Winter, and we grow fatter then, by rea≈øon of the moderate Heat; for great Heat di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolves Fat, and di≈ø≈øipates the Ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and therefore in Fevers, and in Summer, we grow Lean, and have but ≈ømall Appetites.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in Sleep our inner-parts are not hotter than when we are awake, yea they are not ≈øo hot, as appears by the Pul≈øe, that are then more languid
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63575:14"/>and le≈øs, and by the palene≈øs; and this is agreeable to Rea≈øon; for the Blood does not then pa≈øs ≈øo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through the Heart, and con≈øequently does not heat ≈øo much; and our Sweating a Nights does not contradict what has bin ≈øaid, for that proceeds chiefly from Vapours retain'd by the Coverings, and conden≈øed upon the Body.</p>
               <p>The Natural Heat is ≈øometimes ≈øuddainly rai≈øed, as by Anger, or Joy, the Animal Spirits on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count flowing oftner into the Fibres of the Heart, move the Blood oftner, and increa≈øe the Fire of the Heart: This Heat is al≈øo increa≈øed by the motion of the Body, and by the u≈øe of Spices and Wind.</p>
               <p>It is de≈øtroy'd chiefly three ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by ≈øuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, di≈ø≈øipation, and want of repair; it is ≈øuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by too much Blood; as a ≈ømall Fire by too much Wood, or by the Vi≈øco≈øity of the Blood, or the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation of it by Cold or Poi≈øon. It is di≈ø≈øipated by too great Labour, or violent Sweats. It cannot be repair'd when there is want of Meat and Drink, or when the Aliment is weak, or by rea≈øon of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion of the Ve≈ø≈øels, or the thickne≈øs or vi≈øcidity of the Blood. In Old Men the Natural Heat dies, partly becau≈øe it is oppre≈øs'd with Serum, and partly becau≈øe in a long tract of Time it is di≈ø≈øipated.</p>

               <p>AN Humour is a liquid Sub≈øtance in the Body of an Animal, bred according to Nature, by Meat and Drink; it is twofold, Nutritious and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious.</p>

               <p>Nutritious Humours, are Humours apt to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into our Sub≈øtance.

               <p>Blood ≈øtrictly taken, is the redder and more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Portion of the Ma≈øs of Blood; they that have abundance of it are chearful, and comely.</p>
               <p>Flegm is the whiter and cruder Portion of the Ma≈øs of Blood, of a Cold and Moi≈øt Temperament. Tho≈øe that abound with it, are Slow, Sleepy, Pale and Fat.</p>
               <p>Choler is the thinner Portion of the Ma≈øs of Blood, of an hot and dry Temperament: They that have it in abundance, are Angry, Agile, Witty and Lean.</p>
               <p>Melancholy is the earthy and gro≈øs Portion of the Ma≈øs of Blood, of a cold and dry Temperament. They that abound with this Humour, are Sad, Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Black.</p>
               <p>Chyle is a liquid Ma≈øs bred in the Stomach and Guts from Meat and Drink; I ≈øay in the Stomach and Bowels, becau≈øe ≈øome Chylification is made in the≈øe, tho' chiefly in the Stomach; but we ≈øhall ≈øpeak more particularly of Chylification among Natural Actions.</p>
               <p>The Chyle is expelled from the Stomach partly by the Mu≈øcles that contract the Belly, and partly by the impul≈øe of the Liver; and partly by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øtaltic motion of the annular Fibres of the Stomach, ≈øucce≈ø≈øively contracted from the upper Orifice to the lower. The Chyle being thru≈øt from the Stomach into the Guts, is further elaborated there, by the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stomach which it brings with it, and by the Bile and pancreatic Juice, which entring into the Duodenum, and mixt with the Chyle, are fermented together; and together with the Chyle, pa≈øs into the lacteal Veins, which are innumerable ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels,

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63575:16"/>left ≈øubclavian Vein, into who≈øe lower ≈øide it opens, ju≈øt there where the left jugular Vein enters into it on the upper ≈øide, ≈øo that their Mouths face one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but it opens not into this Vein with any large Orifice, but by ≈øix or ≈øeven little ones, being all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered together in the interior Cavity of the Subcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, with one broad Valve looking towards the Cava from the Shoulder, whereby here is granted to the Chyle and Lympha a free pa≈ø≈øage out of the <hi>Ductus Chyliferus</hi> into the Subclavia; but their return, or of Blood with them out of the Vein into the Duct is prevented. This Duct ending thus in the ≈øubclavian Vein, the Chyle that it conveys into it, pa≈ø≈øes with the Blood, returning by the <hi>Cava</hi> into the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart.</p>
               <p>The Chyle in the Stomach and Guts keeps in ≈øome ≈øort, the Colour of what is eaten: So Cows and Sheep, becau≈øe they feed on Gra≈øs, have a greeni≈øh Chyle.

               <p>An excrementitious Humour, is an Humour that is not fit to be converted into our ≈øub≈øtance: 'Tis divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Natural and Preternatural; the Preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral belongs to Pathology.</p>
               <p>The Natural excrementitious Humour, is that which has not an inimical quality.</p>
               <p>Excrementitious Humours are partly generated in the Blood, becau≈øe our Nouri≈øhment has ≈øome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which are apt to become Excrementitious, but partly becau≈øe the Blood lo≈øes much of its ≈øubtile Parts, by being often rarified in the Heart, and by nouri≈øhing our Vital Fire; and on this account, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of its Parts are render'd unfit for u≈øe, and do hurt, unle≈øs they are eliminated from the Ma≈øs of Blood, for the Flegm ≈øtops the pa≈ø≈øages: The Earth, or the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> coagulates; the Water hinders the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63575:17"/>inflammability of the Blood; and the Sulphur by adu≈øtion, becomes bitter and acrid.</p>
               <p>Moreover, divers excrementitious Humours are evacuated in divers places; and meerly according to their diver≈øity, as to magnitude or figure, in this or that emunctory, and in the particles of this or that Humour, without the help of any fictitious Faculty: And this will not ≈øeem ≈øtrange to any one, who ≈øees that meerly by a diver≈øity of the Pores and Parts, a whole≈øom and unwhol≈øome Herb grow near together in the ≈øame Ground; and one ≈øort of Juice ≈ølows in the Tree, another in the Bark, and another in the Leaves and Fruits.</p>
               <p>A Natural excrementitious Humour, is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to u≈øeful and unu≈øeful; a Natural excrementitious Humour is u≈øeful, when of it ≈øelf it is ≈øome way ≈øerviceable to the Body, as Milk, Seed, Men≈øtruous Blood, the Mothers Blood, yellow Choler, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, Serum, the Humour of the Pericardium, the acid Humour of the Stomach, Spittle, Pancreatic Juice, Lympha, and the ≈ølime of the Guts.</p>
               <p>The Natural excrementitious Humour is unu≈øeful, when of it ≈øelf it is no way ≈øerviceable to the Body wherein it is bred; as Urine, Sweat, Tears, Snot, the Blood of a Woman in Labour, the Blood of the Hemorrhoids, and the Wax of the Ears.</p>
               <p>Milk is a portion of the Chyle, ≈øeparated by the glands, into the milky Tubes, for the nouri≈øhment of the Infant.</p>
               <p>The milky Tubes are Ve≈ø≈øels properly belonging to the Brea≈øts, and they come from their innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glands, and terminate in the Paps with many holes; they are incompa≈ø≈øed here and there with Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Fibres from the ≈ømall rope of the Arm-pit, that the≈øe being in≈ølated, they may be contracted to pre≈øs out the Milk.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63575:17"/>
               <p>The Matter of Milk is Chyle, and not Blood, as many heretofore have thought, and that it was turn'd White in the Brea≈øts; but it does not ≈øtay there long enough to be elaborated; and be≈øide, the Parts are not formed for ≈øuch an u≈øe. Moreover, a piece of Succory eaten before, has bin drawn out with it, and al≈øo the Bran of Bread eaten before: A Purging Medicine taken by the Nur≈øe, is pre≈øently mixt with the Milk, and Purges the Child; and ≈øometimes when it does not the Nur≈øe, Saffron and Burnt Wine, and other things taken by the Nur≈øe, communicate the ta≈øt and ≈ømell to the Milk in the ≈øpace of half an hour, or le≈øs; and the Nur≈øe pre≈øently after drinking a large draught, finds a chillne≈øs and fullne≈øs in her Brea≈øts; which could not be if Blood were the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Milk: Be≈øides, a Woman would con≈øume away if Blood were the Matter of Milk; con≈øidering, that a Woman in Health affords daily a Quart of Milk. Moreover, Fat Women have more Milk than Lean, and yet the Lean Women have mo≈øt Blood, and their ≈øanguiferous Ve≈ø≈øels are larger: But you will ≈øay, that Blood is ≈øometimes ≈øucked out of the Brea≈øts, and that in Women that give Suck, the Veins of the Brea≈øts are more Turgid than at other times; and therefore Blood is the Matter of Milk. To the fir≈øt I an≈øwer, That Blood is not ≈øucked without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and therefore this does not prove that it is the Matter of Milk. Secondly, The greater di≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the Veins of the Brea≈øt prove nothing al≈øo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe this is to be imputed to the greater motion of the Blood upwards, by rea≈øon of the compre≈ø≈øion of the lower Arteries by the Womb.</p>
               <p>I ≈øuppo≈øe the Thoracic Duct is the pa≈ø≈øage of the Chyle to the Brea≈øts, from whence ≈øome ≈ømall branches are reflected about the Calvicles, towards the Brea≈øts.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63575:18"/>
               <p>Women with Child have Milk in their Brea≈øts, and e≈øpecially in a few days before Delivery, not becau≈øe the men≈øtruous Blood regurgitates from the Womb through the Epiga≈øtric Ve≈ø≈øels to the Brea≈øts, for the≈øe do not at all communicate one with another; and Circulation refutes this: Be≈øides, ≈øome Virgins have Milk, yea Men and Children; and many Animals which have not the Cour≈øes; but the rea≈øon is, for that in Women with Child, the Child growing big, the Womb is wonderfully expanded, and ≈øo the ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Ve≈ø≈øels of the lower Belly are pre≈øs'd; and therefore the Blood regurgitates upwards, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by its quantity and heat, opens the Pores of the Glands of the Brea≈øts, and cau≈øes the lacteal Tubes to expand more; and for the ≈øame rea≈øon, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of the Chyle are more pre≈ø≈øed, and the Chyle is more forceably driven upwards, and ≈øo opens more the glands and pa≈ø≈øages of the Brea≈øts, and the lacteal Tubes.</p>
               <p>The Milk after Delivery flows more freely; for the Chyle that u≈øed to be carried to the Womb for the Nouri≈øhment of the Child, regurgitates upwards, the pa≈ø≈øages of the Womb being ≈øtopt: Be≈øides, the Infant ≈øucks; and how much that conduces to the production of Milk, none will wonder that reads in Hi≈øtory, that Milk has bin drawn to the Brea≈øts of Virgins, by continual Suction alone.</p>
               <p>The Milk at length cea≈øes, either becau≈øe the Child is wean'd, or becau≈øe the Nur≈øe is with Child, and then the Chyle begins to return to the Womb, for nouri≈øhment of the Foetus; and continues this cour≈øe till the Womb being more di≈øtended, towards the end of gravidation, pre≈ø≈øes the Ve≈ø≈øels of the Chyle.</p>
               <p>The cau≈øe that Children newly born, Old Women, and Men, have Milk in their Brea≈øts, are the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the pa≈ø≈øages of the Brea≈øts, the laxity of the Glands, and the abundance of Chyle.</p>

               <p>Seed is a whiti≈øh Humour turgid with Spirits, bred in the Stones, and <hi>Pro≈øtatae,</hi> and further elaborated for Generation in the carrying Ve≈ø≈øels, and the ≈ømall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Bladders. The Matter of it is Blood carried on both Sides, from the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> in a ≈øtrait Pa≈ø≈øage by the Arteries to the Stones, and there put off thro the ≈ømall Glands that are only vi≈øible by a Micro≈øcope upon the tubulous Sub≈øtance of the Stones; this is confirm'd by the artificial Divi≈øion and Di≈øper≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Arteries in the Stones, and <hi>Pro≈øtata,</hi> and by the Straitne≈øs of them, together with the Wreathing of the corre≈øponding Veins, and the Multitude of Valves, for the≈øe are ≈øo framed, that the Blood may pa≈øs quicker to the Stones, than from them, and that the nobler Part of the Blood may the ea≈øier ≈øweat throught to the tubulous Sub≈øtance of the Stones from the ≈ømall Glands and Arteries every where join'd to it, for the making of Seed.

               <p>But ≈øome will have the nervous Juice to be the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, for the≈øe Rea≈øons, becau≈øe they perceive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nerves in the Te≈øticles, and that the taking away of a great Quantity of Blood, does not ≈øo much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a Man, as the Lo≈øs of a little Seed, and that after Coition, the Head akes, and that ≈øuch as are given to Venery, are ≈øubject to Di≈øtillations from the Brain on the Spinal Marrow. And la≈øtly, becau≈øe the Te≈øticles are white, not red<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> To the fir≈øt I an≈øwer, that the nervous Juice is either Animal Spirit conden≈øated, or another Humour: But the Nature of a Spirit which hath Particles that quickly fly away, cannot conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øate into a Seminal Humour, and the nervous Juice can be no other Humour, for if it were, it wou'd ≈øtop the Pa≈ø≈øage of the Nerves. To the ≈øecond I an≈øwer, this is manife≈øt to Sen≈øe, and they convey a great many Spirits, which ought to be in the Seed, without which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63575:19"/>the Blood could not pa≈øs through tho≈øe innumerable and narrow Tubes which are in the Te≈øticles, nor be changed into prolific Seed, which ought to be made by the various Motion of the Spirits, and the Particles of it, and the working of them among them≈øelves. To the third, fourth, and fifth, I an≈øwer, that it may be ea≈øily under≈øtood that this happens only by the Lo≈øs of Animal Spirits; for the Te≈øticles being emptied, the Nerves proportionably, at lea≈øt tho≈øe which are near, are al≈øo emptied, and then by Rea≈øon of the greater Facility of the Motion towards them, Spirits flow more abundantly into them, and ≈øo the other Parts, and al≈øo the Brain are robb'd, and upon this Account the Fibres are di≈øordered, and the Brain becoming cold, conden≈øes the Vapours, and puts them off on the Spine. To the ≈øixth I an≈øwer, that all the Parts and the Te≈øticles al≈øo are nouri≈øhed with Blood, and yet all are ≈øomewhat white.</p>
               <p>Seed begins to be generated about Puberty, becau≈øe the Heat of the Glands of the Te≈øticles being then greater, opens more the Arteries and ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels, and drives the Blood better through them, and the Nerves are readier to carry Spirits.</p>
               <p>The Seed is of an A≈øhy Colour in the Tubes of the Te≈øticles, but whiter in the Head of the <hi>Epydidimidis,</hi> it is made in the Te≈øticles and <hi>Pro≈øtatae,</hi> and is conveyed by the carrying Ve≈ø≈øels by a very ≈ømall and winding Duct to the Seminal Bladders, wherein it is kept, and further elaborated, till by Titillation the Nerves and Fibres about the Sides of them, being much inflated, pre≈øs out the Seed, which is then very turgid with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, into the Urethra, through the Holes of the Gland that ≈øtops the Seminal Bladders.</p>
               <p>The Stones are the Shop of the Seed, and therefore Eunuchs have not Seed, but ≈øome Titillation they have, by rea≈øon of a certain Humour that drops from the <hi>Pro≈øtatae</hi> into the Urethra, but this is not true
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63575:19"/>Seed. And yet Eunuchs may have Seed in the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øufficient for Copulation once or twice, and may impregnate a Woman.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe which do not indulge them≈øelves in Venery, and live cha≈øtely, do not generate much Seed, for the Pa≈ø≈øages are narrowed by degrees, and the Seminal Matter turns back, and nouri≈øhes and makes fat the Loins and other Parts.</p>
               <p>Women have prolifick Seed, if by that you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the Eggs whereof their Te≈øticles are full, which being made fruitful, and expanded by the Man's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Air, break out of the Cups wherein they are chiefly contain'd, into the Fallopian Tubes, and from thence into the Cavity of the Womb.</p>
               <p>That Humour which Women emit in Copulation, is not true Seed, becau≈øe that is ejected without, about the Clytoris and Orifice of the Privities, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Womb; this is manife≈øt in big-bellied Women, the Orifice of who≈øe Womb is always clo≈øe ≈øhut, and cover'd with a yellow Mucilage. And be≈øides, many Women conceive, and yet, as they ≈øay, have not emitted that Humour: Moreover, it has ≈øeldom the Con≈øi≈øtence of Seed, nor is it Spirituous, becau≈øe Whores copulating often in a Day, are not weakened by the Excretion of it, nor is it elaborated as Seed, for it is not generated in the Organs of it, but in the Glands.</p>
               <p>The Furrows of the Womb emit this Humour, or certain Ducts opening into the Sheath from the <hi>Pro≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae</hi> or other Glands of the Womb, by Rea≈øon of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation, and the Con≈øtriction of the Fibres of the Womb, which happens in Coition.</p>
               <p>And yet this Humour is profitable, becau≈øe it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually moi≈øtens the Sheath, and perhaps it conduces to the Elevation of the Man's Seminal Spirit or Air from the Sheath to the Cavity of the Womb, and from thence to the Eggs to make them fruitful.</p>

               <p>Men≈øtruous Blood, is Blood abounding in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is evacuated by the Womb Monthly.</p>
               <p>The chief Cau≈øe is the abounding of the Blood at a certain Time, Heat and the ea≈øie Dilatation of the Womb al≈øo help. That a Plenitude is the Cau≈øe may be proved, for that they that have mo≈øt Blood, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate mo≈øt this way, and then ru≈øtic Women, that con≈øume much Blood by Labour, have little or no men≈øtruous Flux, and tho≈øe who have lo≈øt much Blood by Venefaction, have few or no Cour≈øes at all: Men al≈øo who do not abound with Blood, by Rea≈øon of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and more Heat, have no ≈øuch Flux.

Tho≈øe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are hot have the Cour≈øes ≈øooner, but in a le≈øs Quantity, and not ≈øo long as tho≈øe that are cold.</p>
               <p>Some ≈øay the Cau≈øe of the Cour≈øes is a certain Saline Ferment of the Womb, being gradually depo≈øited on the Sub≈øtance of it, whereby the Womb collecting much Fire in it ≈øelf, is turgid, rarefied, and dilated, grows hot, and evacuates the more fluid Blood, until that Ferment is carried off, and this Ferment they ≈øay is manife≈øt from tho≈øe things which move the Cour≈øes, for they con≈øi≈øt of much volatile Salt.</p>
               <p>According to the≈øe Cau≈øes the Cour≈øes begin to ≈ølow about the fourteenth Year, becau≈øe the Body then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a manner its due Magnitude, the Blood begins to abound, and to be luxuriant in the Womb and other Parts, and hence the Brea≈øts grow big, the Womb is le≈øs wrinkled, and does not pre≈øs its Arteries ≈øo much, and a greater Heat exagitates the Blood more violently, dilates the Arteries, and opens them.</p>

               <p>The men≈øtruous Blood is brought fir≈øt to the Sheath of the Womb, and not to the Bottom of it, for it ≈øometimes flows in Women with Child, and if it ≈øhou'd drop from the Bottom, it wou'd putrifie, and injure the Child and its Nouri≈øhment, and ≈øo occa≈øion Abortion.</p>

               <p>Spittle is a ≈øerous Humour, that drops from the ≈øalivary Ducts, the≈øe Ducts are Ve≈ø≈øels of their Kind, four of them are mo≈øt noted, the two uppermo≈øt that take their Origine with various Branches from the parotid Glands, and at the Jaws run under the Skin with a manife≈øt Orifice into the Mouth. The lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt al≈øo proceed with divers Branches from maxillary Glands, whereof one that is greater, before it reaches the common Trunk, is carried under the diga≈øtric Mu≈øcle of the Jaws.

The Matter of the Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is carried to the≈øe Glands by the Arteries: It di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtils, moreover, in all the Mouth, as from the Glands under the Tongue, and from the Almonds which have two clear Bladders placed near them, that receive the <hi>Serum,</hi> from the Glands, and pour it out into the Mouth: There is al≈øo, on both ≈øides, a common large oval Sinus, that opens into the Mouth, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in its Fringe, two greater Sinus's, and ≈øeveral others, that are le≈øs, with other Glands, each where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath a ≈ømall perforated Sinus in the Middle.</p>

               <p>The Spittle returns continually, with or without Chyle, to the Heart by the lacteal Veins.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63575:23"/>
               <p>When we ≈ømell or ≈øee any thing that is plea≈øant, or greedily long for any thing, the Spittle waters the Mouth more plentifully, becau≈øe the Nerves of the wandring Pair, do not only ≈øend Branches to the Ducts and ≈øalivary Glands, but al≈øo ≈øome to the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and optick Nerves; upon which account a great Influx into the≈øe, affects al≈øo the Nerves of the wandring Pair, and ≈øo by a Contraction of the ≈ømall Fibres, the Salivary Ducts are narrowed, and the Spittle is ejected.</p>
               <p>The rouling about of a Bullet, or the like, in the Mouth, quenches Thir≈øt, becau≈øe by moving the Tongue, we narrow the Ducts, and ≈øo pre≈øs out the Spittle.</p>
               <p>Ju≈øt as we are about to vomit, Spittle flows more abundantly from the Mouth, becau≈øe the Stomach participates with the Maxillary Glands by the Branches of the Nerve of the ≈øixth Pair, and its inner Tunick is continued to the Jaws and Palate, and ≈øo they are contracted by Sympathy, and ca≈øt forth their Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in the ≈øame manner vomiting is provoked by irritating the Membrane at the Beginning of the Oe≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus.</p>
               <p>The acid or dige≈øtive Humour of the Stomach, is an acid Humour, that di≈øtills continually from the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics of the Stomach; it may be proved there is ≈øuch a thing, becau≈øe 'tis often found in the Stomachs of Dogs that have been di≈ø≈øected, after they have fa≈øted a while; and ≈øometimes we belch it up in a Morning, though we are well, and after due Chylification, and the Teeth are often ≈øet on Edge in vomiting by this mixt with the Meat, and by taking Acids Chylificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is further'd, and therefore there is an Acid in the Stomach, which is the Cau≈øe of Chylification. But you will ≈øay that I have only proved that there is an acid Juice in the Stomach, and not that it is natural; it may proceed from Chylification vitiated, as we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63575:23"/>often ≈øee it happens in a Morning after Surfeiting. Moreover, an Acid is the Cau≈øe of Ob≈øtructions and Coagulations in the Body, and it irritates the Nerves, and the like: And con≈øequently 'tis not naturally in the Stomach. I an≈øwer, 'tis certain that ≈øome acid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour mu≈øt be generated in the Stomach, becau≈øe there is ≈øcarce any Aliment that does not contain ≈øome Acid, and therefore the Generation of it is natural, though ≈øometimes this Juice is too acid, or there is too great a Quantity of it, and then it much injures the Body: So Choler, though it be natural, if it be too much heighten'd, or abound too much, occa≈øions Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes.</p>
               <p>And 'tis probable that ≈øuch a Juice ≈øweats continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into the Inte≈øtines through their glandulous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic.</p>
               <p>The Matter of it is a ≈øerous Humour, mixt with acid Particles, but it is not natural excrementitious Melancholy, as was wont to be ≈øaid; for it is thicker than that.

               <p>The pancreatic Juice is a ≈øerous Humour that is poured out of the Pancreas into the Inte≈øtine.</p>
               <p>The Pancreas is a certain Body of many Glands, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a common membrane of Ve≈ø≈øels and Nerves, the branches of them being fa≈øtened among them≈øelves; it is tran≈øver≈øly placed under the Stomach: One of the extremities of it is extended to the Spleen, the other is bound to the <hi>inte≈øtinum duodenum,</hi> and de≈øcends a little with it. The Pancreas has an excretory Ve≈ø≈øel proper to it, con≈øi≈øting of many Branches, each whereof has annext to it, the Glands of the Pancreas; yea, it does in ≈øome ≈øort receive them: It is commonly call'd the pancreatic Duct, and it is wont to be in≈øerted in the ≈øame mouth with the <hi>ductus choliclochus,</hi> obliquely into the <hi>inte≈øtinum duodenum,</hi> or the beginning of the <hi>Jejunum.</hi>

               <p>The Blood being carried by the Arteries, and force upon the Glands of the Pancreas, conveys the pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic Juice through the pores of them into the branches of the Duct; and from the≈øe branches it di≈øtills into the greater Duct, and thence into the Inte≈øtine, in a ≈ømall quantity; for it can ≈øcarce be ≈øeen, when the Duct is bound in a living Dog. It has a ≈øub-acid Ta≈øt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon its acid ≈øaline Particles are diluted with Serum; and when the Choler is poured on it, it occa≈øions a Fermentation. The u≈øe of it is to ferment the Chyle with the Choler in the Inte≈øtine: Moreover, it attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates the Choler, that it ≈øhould not hurt the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtine; and it dilutes the Chyle.</p>
               <p>Lympha is a lympid ≈øerous Humour, contain'd in the Lymphatic Ve≈ø≈øels. The≈øe Lymphatic Ve≈ø≈øels are very ≈ømall and pellucid, and they ari≈øe almo≈øt from every part of the Body, and ab≈øorb the Liquor of them; and that they may pa≈øs the ≈øafer, they here and there encircle the greater Ve≈ø≈øels (as may be ≈øeen in the Limbs and <hi>Vena Porta</hi> near the Liver) like Ivy.</p>
               <p>As far as we can learn by the Con≈øtitution of the Valves, and by Ligature and Inflation, the Lymphatic Ve≈ø≈øels that are below the Diaphragm, chie≈øly end in the common receptacle of the Chyle, the re≈øt above the Diaphragm, are in≈øerted at the concour≈øe of the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar with the Axillary, into the upper part of the thora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Duct, and Pericardium; and there they di≈øcharge their Lympha by manife≈øt pa≈ø≈øages, defended with a Valve; here and there they cannot be ≈øeen, becau≈øe on the account of Tenuity, the parts under appear through tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels, and we can't ea≈øily di≈øtingui≈øh them, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the parts are white; but ≈øometimes the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha is a little red or yellowi≈øh, and then they appear the better, and al≈øo after the Death of a Creature; for then the Ve≈ø≈øels are more di≈øtended, by rea≈øon the motion of the Lympha is ≈ølow.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63575:24"/>
               <p>The u≈øe of the Lympha is to dilute the Chyle in the Receptacle, that it may the ea≈øier a≈øcend through the thoracic Duct; and in the Jugular Vein, it renders the venous Blood that is deprived of its own Serum more fluxile, that it may the ea≈øier rarifie in the Heart; and it re≈øtores the humour of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricardium.</p>
               <p>The ≈ølime of the Guts is a vi≈øcid and glutinous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that covers the Guts within; the Stomach has ≈øome of it, but it is mo≈øt in the Guts.

               <p>The u≈øe of this Slime is to defend the Nervous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic again≈øt the acrimony and roughne≈øs of the Choler, and of things taken in; and probably becau≈øe it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Acidity it conduces to Chylification.</p>
               <p>When Choler, or a purging Medicine is very Acrid, the Slime is melted or rubb'd off, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Patient; for Gripes and the bloody Flux are occa≈øion'd thereby.</p>
               <p>Sweat is a ≈øerous Humour breaking through the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dori≈øic Ve≈ø≈øels of the Skin, in form of Water. The≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels are ≈ømall Tubes in the Pores running out to the Cuticle, and each of them has a Gland under, through which the Serum, the Matter of Sweat is ≈øeparated, they may be ≈øeen with a Micro≈øcope.</p>
               <p>Sweat by rea≈øon of ≈øalt Particles mixt with it, is Salt. The efficient cau≈øe of natural Sweat is Heat, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Sun, of the Fire, Exerci≈øe, Coverings, and the like, whereby the Blood is more agitated and diffu≈øed through the habit of the Body; and the mouths of the Arteries near the Skin are more opened, and the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Particles that are more flexile, and that ≈øtick le≈øs to others, run out of them; and if there be any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity in the Skin, they carry it off with them through
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63575:25"/>the Pores of the Skin; but becau≈øe they do not pa≈øs free enough, and quick enough, many of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being heapt together, are conden≈øed into drops for otherwi≈øe they would pa≈øs by in≈øen≈øible Tran≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as always ≈øome thin part does in Sweating. From what has bin ≈øaid, it appears that plenty of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and a moderate apertion of the Pores, conduce much to Sweat; but that too great an apertion of the Pores, becau≈øe it does not at all hinder the Flux of the Serum, conduces mo≈øt to in≈øen≈øible Tran≈øpiration, and too great a Con≈øtriction of the Pores hinders Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when 'tis once begun, it much increa≈øes it: And hence Sweat occa≈øion'd in Winter by Exerci≈øe, is much more than in Summer.</p>
               <p>We Sweat more ≈øometimes after clean≈øing the Face, becau≈øe the Pores are freed from the Sweat that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructs them. Sweat is ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed by ≈øitting near the Fire, becau≈øe the Pores are thereby enlarged, and the Vapours fly away in≈øen≈øibly; and this is al≈øo the rea≈øon why Sweat ≈øooner goes off when we ≈øit ≈øtill in the Sun, than under the Shade of a Tree; and al≈øo why he Sweats more that runs in the Shade, than he that runs in the Sun.</p>
               <p>We Sweat mo≈øt in the Arm-pits and Groins, becau≈øe tho≈øe parts being mo≈øt cover'd, the Vapours are more retain'd. We Sweat when we Sleep, becau≈øe then we are either oppre≈ø≈øed with Clothes, or at lea≈øt, cover'd with them all over; and becau≈øe the animal Spirits in Sleep do not ≈øufficiently flow to the outer Parts and Mu≈øcles, and ≈øo the Vapours ≈øtay about the Skin, or by rea≈øon of the covering do not ≈øufficiently fly away.</p>
               <p>Smiths and Ru≈øtic People ≈øeldom Sweat, becau≈øe by their Filth the Pores are ≈øhut. Our Hands and Feet Sweat mo≈øt, becau≈øe in them the Arteries are carried ≈øtraiter to the Skin, and their Mouths are more open there, that the Blood may return to the Veins, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63575:25"/>on this account the Serum is put off there more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully. It has bin ob≈øerved, that a per≈øon Drinking plentifully of <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Wine, has render'd his Sweat like it; but this proceeded from too great a quantity, whereby the heat of the Heart being almo≈øt ≈øuffocated, cou'd ≈øcarce change it.</p>
               <p>Our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour in the Garden Sweat Blood, partly out of Love to us, and his mo≈øt holy Father; his Blood did ≈øo Ferment that it could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Arteries, and partly by rea≈øon of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unto Death, there was ≈øo great Horrour and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øion of the Parts, that Blood was violently pre≈øs'd out of the Pores.</p>

               <p>Urine is a ≈øerous Humour ≈øtrain'd in the Reins, which comes with the Blood (which it diluted) to the Reins by the Arteries of the Kidnies, but is ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it as ≈øuper≈øtuous, and that continually, as part of the Blood is continually driven to the Reins to nouri≈øh them. It is ≈øtrein'd in the Reins in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner; the Blood mixt with the Serum forces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the glandulous ≈øub≈øtance of the Reins, and by this impul≈øe, pre≈øently ≈øome thin particles are ≈øeparated through the Pores of it into many ≈ømall Tubes, whereof chiefly con≈øi≈øts the inner ≈øub≈øtance of the Reins; and from the≈øe ending for the mo≈øt part in eight or nine papillary Caruncles, they pa≈øs into the Pelvis, and thence into the Ureters and Bladder; the re≈øt which came to the Reins, returns partly to the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> by the emulgent Veins, and dilutes, and carries the Blood as before.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides, the Serum of the Blood Choler is mixt with the Urine, and tinctures it of a yellowi≈øh Colour, and

But that which was before in the Thoracic Duct, or in the Veins or Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is thru≈øt forward by it: And then the potulent Matter runs its Cour≈øe ≈øoon enough; and 'tis very probable that the Blood in any healthy Man, fini≈øhes its Cour≈øe in a Quarter of an Hours time, ≈øo that 'tis no ≈øuch ≈øtrange thing that we make Water ≈øo ≈øoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Drinking, yet 'tis not ≈øo very ≈øoon as is ≈øaid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs the Bladder were di≈øtended with Urine before. As to the Smell and Colour, which ≈øometimes the Urine has from things that are taken in, as we ≈øee when A≈øparagus or Madder are eat, the≈øe are not al≈øo ≈øufficient Proofs for particular Pa≈ø≈øages, for this may be becau≈øe things taken in do not continue long enough in the Blood, ≈øo as to wholly put off their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in it; and this is ≈øo much the more, by how much the ≈øaid things that are odoriferous, and that give a Tincture, are more aperitive: Moreover, ≈øome Hi≈øtorians relate, that a Per≈øon, after drinking a large Quantity of <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Wine, has ≈øweat it out in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Ta≈øt as before, and therefore it may be as rea≈øonably expected that we ≈øhou'd ≈øhew particular Pa≈ø≈øages in this Ca≈øe, as for the Urine, when it has the Qualities of the Liquor taken in, and yet there are hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto no ≈øuch Pa≈ø≈øages found out for the Sweat.</p>
               <p>But I wou'd not be ≈øo under≈øtood, as that I wou'd wholly reject particular Pa≈ø≈øages, for that there are ≈øuch is very plau≈øible, and I hope they will be found out at one time or another, by the Indu≈øtry of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Anatomi≈øts.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63575:27"/>
               <p>The Urine falling continually from the Reins through the Ureters to the Bladder, is retain'd in it, until by the Quantity or Quality, it ≈øtimulates to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. It is evacuated by a Contraction of the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Belly, and of the Fibres of the Bladder, whil≈øt they being irritated, the Spirits flow more plentifully into them; and how great the Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bladder is, may be ≈øeen in the Di≈ø≈øection of a Bea≈øt; which, when it is va≈øtly expanded, after Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Urine, ≈øinks into a very ≈ømall Compa≈øs: Le≈øt the Urine ≈øhou'd flow out when we are ≈øleeping, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily, a great round Mu≈øcle is placed before the Neck of the Bladder, call'd Sphincter; ≈øuch an one a is at the End of the right Gut, for retaining the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement; and therefore to make Water, we contract the Belly and Bladder ≈øo much, as to ≈øomewhat over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Action of the Sphincter, which is perpetua Contraction.</p>
               <p>The Urine cannot return again from the Bladder to the Ureters, becau≈øe they are obliquely in≈øerted within the Membranes of the Bladder, and ≈øo when it lyes up on them it ≈øhuts their Pa≈ø≈øages.</p>
               <p>In a Calf, and the like, all the time they are in the Womb, the Urine is evacuated through the upper Part of the Bladder, but not ≈øo in an Humane Foetus, which either voids it into the Womb, or it is kept it the Bladder all the time the Child is in the Womb.</p>
               <p>We make more Water in the Winter than in the Summer, and ≈øo being placed in cold Water, becau≈øe by the Stoppage of the Pores in≈øen≈øible Tran≈øpiration is hindred, and the Serum is diverted to the inner Parts.</p>
               <p>Tears are a ≈øerous Humour, flowing from the Eye of tho≈øe that weep: The Matter of them is a Vapour; and ≈øalt Serum, continually brought through the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with the Blood, to the weeping Glands, to lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate and moi≈øten the Eye, and through them ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtered
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63575:27"/>into the weeping Ducts, which are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in the Eye-lids.</p>
               <p>Serum flowing in too great a Quantity to the Eye: Al≈øo Collyria ≈øometimes running through the No≈øtrils and Palate, through the weeping Gland, placed in the greater Angle of the Eye, that is very ≈øpongy, and through three or four Holes of the Bone of the No≈øe, are ta≈øted in the Mouth; through the≈øe Holes the Rayes of the Sun enter partly the No≈øtils, when looking on the Sun we ≈øneeze.</p>
               <p>Our Eyes water upon the account of a Moat, A≈øh, Smoak, Onions, Garlic, and the like; becau≈øe by rea≈øon of the≈øe, Pain being occa≈øion'd in the Eye, there is a greater Flux of Blood than is u≈øual, and a proportionable Separation of Serum; or becau≈øe, by reiterated Contractions of the Belly, then intervening, the Bowels pre≈øs more the Aorta, and the Blood, with its Serum, is more moved upwards, and for the ≈øame rea≈øon in other Pains; in Trumpeting, Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ≈øneezing, drinking, and the like, our Eyes water.</p>
               <p>In Sorrow Tears flow, partly becau≈øe by rea≈øon of a le≈ø≈øer Influx of the Spirits, the Pores of the Eye fall down, and the Vapours gather together; partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe now and then, by rea≈øon of interluding Love or Joy, without which there is no Sorrow, the Blood being driven generou≈øly through the Body, puts off its Serum more largely on the weeping Ducts.</p>
               <p>Snot is a clammy and vi≈øcid Humour ≈øticking to the No≈øtrils; the Matter of it comes from the internal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the No≈øtrils; or it may be a flegmatic Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour pour'd out of the Arteries upon the Brain, and may pa≈øs from thence through the <hi>Os Cribro≈øum</hi> into the No≈øtrils, and grow thick there by the Cold, or by alternate Expiration and In≈øpiration of the Air, whereby its thin Particles are dry'd up; for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary Proce≈ø≈øes are hollow to the Ventricles that are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63575:28"/>before: And part of it may be al≈øo a Vapour conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in the No≈øtrils; but it does not come, as is ≈øaid, through the Hole of the Bone of the Skull to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, for here are no Pa≈ø≈øages for it, but all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour coming from the Ventricles to the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> and pituitary Gland, is refunded through the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane under the Gland that is pervious with many ≈ømall Holes, into the jugular Veins that are placed on each ≈øide of the <hi>Cella turcica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we expire, or in≈øpire ≈øtrongly, the Mouth being ≈øhut, the Snot is carried with the Air to the No≈øtrils from the Palate; and ≈øo on the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Blood of a Woman in Child-bed, is Blood whereby the Woman is purged in her lying in. Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed is the Time from Delivery, to the Purification of the Woman.</p>
               <p>The Water of a Woman in Delivery, is that which flows from the Womb at the Time of Delivery: The Matter of it is the Urine, Sweat, and ≈øuperfluous Chyle of the Child contain'd in the Amnion, it flows out when the Child, by kicking, breaks the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and ≈øometimes a long while before the Child is born; but it is better not to break ≈øo, for by lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Pa≈ø≈øages, it facilitates the Birth.</p>
               <p>The hemorrhoidal Blood is a Portion of Blood abounding, which is carried off by the hemorrhoidal Arteries, and it ≈øerves in Men as the Cour≈øes in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>A Spirit is the thinne≈øt and mo≈øt agile Part of the Body; the Matter of it is the fine≈øt, that is, the mo≈øt ≈øulphureous Part of the Blood: That there is ≈øuch a thing as Spirit, may be proved; becau≈øe, if you bind or cut off the Nerve of any Part, ≈øo as that the Spirit can't come to it, the Motion and Sen≈øe of it pre≈øently peri≈øh.</p>
               <p>Spirit is commonly divided into animal, vital, and natural; but I ≈øuppo≈øe there is but one Spirit; which,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63575:28"/>becau≈øe it performs animal Actions, is animal; which moves when it flows into the medullary Part of the Nerve, which ≈øerves for Motion; it gives Sen≈øe when it flows upon the Membrane which ≈øerves for Sen≈øe, and it is vital as it performs vital Actions, and natural as it performs natural Actions; and ≈øo the re≈øt without any ≈øpecific Di≈øtinction. Animal Spirit is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the Head only, by Separation from the Blood when it forces thro the Branches of the carotid Arteries, upon the external Sub≈øtance of the Brain and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> that is more lax than the re≈øt; pre≈øently the fine≈øt Particles recede from it into the Pores of the Brain and <hi>Cerebellum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spirit makes its Excur≈øions from the Brain three ways: Fir≈øt, By the Command of the Mind. Secondly, 'tis expell'd by the Contraction of the Heart, that forces the Blood upon the Brain and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum;</hi> and new Spirits being pre≈øently ≈øeparated from it, force by the wole Dia≈øtole of the Brain, and partly by the Sy≈øtole, the animal Spirits previou≈øly exi≈øting in the Brain, into the Beginning of the Nerves; and this Motion of the Spirits is moderate and ≈ølow, and thereby the Ten≈øion of all the Mu≈øcles is equal; and hence it is manife≈øt, why by every Pul≈øe there is a Concu≈ø≈øion of the whole Body, tho this may al≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Blood continually thru≈øt into the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. 'Tis manife≈øt al≈øo, why one Arm being cut off, the other grows ≈øtrong thereupon, and why to one of two antagoni≈øt Mu≈øcles the other is convul≈øively drawn, and which way it is drawn, it carries the Part with it: <hi>viz.</hi> becau≈øe then the ≈øaid Parts are puffed up and extended with a greater Quantity of Spirits. Thirdly, The Spirit flows from the Brain when any Part is irritated; for then, by the Motion of the ≈ømall Fibres of the Nerves, the Pores in the Brain are opened; and ≈øo in Re≈øpiration, in the Motion of the Heart, in the peri≈øtaltic Motion, and the like; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63575:29"/>there is a certain natural Irritation, and ≈øo it flows when ≈øome Member being tickled or irritated, is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwi≈øe drawn, but then the Irritation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural. But by rea≈øon of ≈øuch an Apertion of the Pores of the Brain, this Efflux of Spirits is ≈øuch, that it does not only fall upon the Nerves of the Part irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but al≈øo upon the neighbouring Nerves; and this is the chief Cau≈øe of Sympathy, which is ob≈øerved in divers Parts; for In≈øtance, betwixt the Reins and Stomach, by rea≈øon whereof, tho≈øe being irritated, vomiting is occa≈øion'd; and ≈øo betwixt the Colon and the Stomach, as when that is affected the Patient vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>
               <p>The Spirits ≈øerving involuntary Actions, come chiefly from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and the medullary Furrows from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> to the Nerves of the wandring Pair, ≈øhew this; and this is the Rea≈øon why, in an Apoplexy, the Pul≈øe and Re≈øpiration do not quite cea≈øe, which is partly performed by tho≈øe Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Spirits, in their natural State, being about to cau≈øe Motion, are not fired like Gun-powder in the Brain, or exploded thence: For if ≈øo, Motion cou'd not be re≈øtrain'd at any Time when we wou'd.</p>
               <p>The Spirit conduces ≈øomewhat to the Nutrition of the Parts, by ≈øeparating their Fibres, and the Sides of the Pores from one another, and ≈øo by making way for the Blood.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V. </hi>Of Parts in general.</head>
               <p>A Part is a Body cohering to the Whole, fitted for the Function and U≈øe of it; I do not add, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the common Life, as ≈øome do, that they may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63575:29"/>exclude the Hair, Nails, Humours, and Spirits, which are all truly Parts; for as to the Hairs and Nails, they ≈øhew Life as other Parts do which are nouri≈øhed, and they grow with all Dimen≈øions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as other Parts do, by receiving Nouri≈øhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and by applying it to Parts that are defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and not only by placing it at the Root, for the Nails have ≈ømall Arteries, and the Hairs are hollow, and for the mo≈øt part triangular, as the Micro≈øcope ≈øhews, and in the <hi>plica polonica</hi> they ≈øweat out Blood: It matters not that the Hairs grow upon tabid People, and on ≈øuch as are dead, for in them there is a Di≈ø≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Colliquation of the Body, which makes the Hairs grow mo≈øt, by yielding an agreeable Nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> a ≈øat Vapour exhaling from the Body, as appears from the Inflammability, the fat Fume, and Odor of them; al≈øo from that oyly and clammy Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ≈øticks to the Hairs, if they are not frequently cleans'd. La≈øtly, They are profitable; for, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pores of the Skin open, they conduce to the Expul≈øion of a ≈øooty Excrement, as when a Stick is fixt in the Earth, the Earth about it is dryer. On the Eye-lids, they defend the Eyes, and tho≈øe on the Head defend it, and the like. The Nails are to ≈øtrengthen the Fingers, and render them capable to apprehend ≈ømall things.</p>
               <p>But the Humours and Spirits do not grow, do not live, nor increa≈øe vitally, but only by the Appo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new Matter, as Rain-water is increa≈øed in a Tub, and yet notwith≈øtanding the Humours are Parts; and indeed, the mo≈øt noble and mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary, as well as the watry Humour of the Eye, which almo≈øt all allow to be a Part, tho it is not nouri≈øhed and grows.</p>
               <p>All the ≈øolid Parts are of them≈øelves white, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the wa≈øhing and Maceration of them in Water, whereby they put off the Tincture of the Blood, with which they are all nouri≈øhed.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:63575:30"/>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Parts are divided into fluid and ≈øolid; the fluid are the Blood and Spirits, the ≈øolid all that are di≈øtinct from them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are divided into organic, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organic.</p>
               <p>An organic Part is a Part which requires a ≈øpecial Conformation, for performing the Action it is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øign'd, as the Eye, Ear, No≈øe, and the like.</p>
               <p>An inorganic Part is a Part which does not require a ≈øpecial Conformation for performing the Action it is peculiarly de≈øigned, as ≈øimple Fle≈øh, a Membrane. I ≈øay, the Action for which it is peculiarly de≈øign'd, becau≈øe, as to the common Actions, in all the Parts, for in≈øtance Nutrition, no determinate Conformation is required.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Part is divided into Principal and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtring: The principal Part is that which be≈øtows ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on the whole Body, that is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to Life. The mini≈øtring Part is that which does not be≈øtow any thing on the whole Body that is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to Life.</p>
               <p>The principal Parts (at lea≈øt among the Solids, for among the Fluids, Blood and Spirits are ≈øuch) are the Brain, which be≈øtows Spirits on the whole Body, and the Heart, which be≈øtows Blood on the whole Body; for if the Heart ≈øhould not give Blood, the Brain would pre≈øently ≈øuffer an Eclip≈øe of all its Actions, and other Parts could not live without this; and if the Brain ≈øhould not ≈øupply the Heart with Spirits, whereby it is ≈øucce≈ø≈øively con≈øtringed, Death would ≈øoon follow. The other Parts mini≈øter, e≈øpecially tho≈øe which carry, for in≈øtance, the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves: The Stomach, Liver, Lungs, and Stones, are fal≈øly accounted by ≈øome, principal Parts, for they do not ≈øupply any thing that is ab≈øolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to Life; for we live many Days fa≈øting, or only with nouri≈øhing Gly≈øters, and divers know how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63575:30"/>to ≈øtop their Breath a great while, and the Liver ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no more than other Parts, and the Te≈øticles, tho they make Life more perfect, yet are not ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely nece≈ø≈øary to Life, as is evident in Eunuchs and Geldings.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A Part is wont to be divided by the Schools, into ≈øimilar and di≈ø≈øimilar. A ≈øimilar is ≈øuch an one whereof all the Parts appear, at fir≈øt View, of the ≈øame Sub≈øtance. A di≈ø≈øimilar is ≈øuch an one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the Parts do not appear, at fir≈øt View, of the ≈øame Sub≈øtance. I ≈øay, at fir≈øt View, becau≈øe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, many that are wont to be reckon'd ≈øimilar, are not ≈øuch, for there are very few wherein you ≈øhall not ob≈øerve a diver≈øe Sub≈øtance.</p>
               <p>A Bone, a Cartilage, a Fibre, a Membrane, the Cuticle, Skin, Hair, Fle≈øh, a Tendon, a Gland, Fat, a Nerve, an Artery, a Vein, lymphatic Ve≈ø≈øels, the lacteal Veins, and the like, are counted ≈øimilar Parts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a Part is divided into ≈øpermatic, ≈øanguine, and mixt; a ≈øpermatic Part is wont to be defined a Part, who≈øe Matter is wholly, in its fir≈øt Formation, Seed. A ≈øanguineous Part is a Part, who≈øe Matter is wholly, in its fir≈øt Formation, Blood. A mixt Part is a Part, which is made, in its fir≈øt Formation, of an equal Portion of Blood and Seed. I ≈øay, in its fir≈øt Formation, becau≈øe it is certain, that in the adult they chiefly con≈øi≈øt of Blood, wherewith they are all nouri≈øhed.</p>
               <p>A Bone, a Cartilage, a Nerve, a Fibre, a Tendon, a Membrane, an Artery, a Vein, the Marrow of the Brain, the Hairs, Nails, and the like, are counted ≈øpermatic: Al≈øo the fourfold Fle≈øh, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fle≈øh of the Mu≈øcles, which is generated of Blood, lightly concreted, and is red and fibrous: The Fle≈øh, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma of the Vi≈øcera, which is the proper Sub≈øtance of each of them, as of the Reins, Spleen, Liver, and Lungs; the Ve≈ø≈øels whereof it ≈øtrengthens, and fills up
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63575:31"/>their void Spaces, the particular Fle≈øh of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Part, as that of the Stomach, Inte≈øtines, Womb, Bladder, and the like. La≈øtly, the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Fle≈øh, which con≈øtitutes the Glands. The Fle≈øh is counted mixt, but whether all the Parts of it are ≈øuch, ≈øo as that ≈øome of them are only compounded of Seed, and others only of Blood, and others of equal Parts of both, I much doubt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A Part is wont to be divided, from its Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, into animal, vital, and natural: An animal Part is a Part that is principally de≈øign'd for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animal Functions, ≈øuch are the animal Spirit, the Brain, ≈øpinal Marrow, Nerves, Eye, Ear, No≈øe, Tongue, with the Palate, the membranous, and nervous Parts, and the like, which conduce to animal Actions.</p>
               <p>A vital Part is a Part principally contrived for vital Functions; ≈øuch are the Heart and Lungs.</p>
               <p>A natural Part is a Part principally contrived for natural Functions; Such are the Stomach, Guts, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen, Pancreas, Genital Parts, and the like.</p>

               <p>An animal Faculty is a Faculty producing animal Actions: This is wont to be ≈øubdivided, as the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63575:31"/>Action, into the ≈øen≈øitive, appetitive, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty; and the ≈øen≈øitive again into external and internal: But all the≈øe do not differ really among them≈øelves, and <hi>a parte rei,</hi> are the very Soul, con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Efficient of this or that Operation.</p>
               <p>The natural Faculty is a Faculty producing natural Actions: It is as various as natural Actions are, and is <hi>a parte rei,</hi> Blood and Spirits, and other Di≈øpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Parts, as to Magnitude, Figure, and the like, as they produce natural Actions.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII. </hi>Of Action in general, and its Species, but e≈øpecially of the internal and external Sen≈øes.</head>
               <p>ACtion in general is a certain Operation, which is produced in us, either by the Mind or Body: It is divided into animal and natural. An animal Action is an Action that is produced by the Soul, and is fivefold, <hi>viz.</hi> the Under≈øtanding, the Will, Sen≈øe, ≈øen≈øitive Appetite, and animal Motion.</p>
               <p>Sen≈øe is twofold, external and internal. Internal is threefold, <hi>viz.</hi> common Sen≈øe, Fancy, and Memory. External is fivefold, <hi>viz.</hi> Sight, Hearing, Ta≈øting, Smelling, and Touching.</p>
               <p>All the≈øe animal Actions are not really di≈øtingui≈øhed from the Soul, nor con≈øequently among them≈øelves; for the Under≈øtanding is the Soul, as it independently, from the Body, produces certain Thoughts; and the Will is the Soul, as without Dependence on the Body, it exerci≈øes tho≈øe Affections, which we call the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Will; and the Sen≈øe is the Soul, as it knows ≈øome things by means of a corporeal Organ; and it is internal, if the Organ of it is the Brain, and external
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63575:32"/>if any other Part be the Organ: It is Sight, if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of it be the Eye; and Hearing, if the Organ of it be the Ear: It is the common Sen≈øe, as in the Brain, but e≈øpecially in the middle Part of the <hi>Medulla oblon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata,</hi> it perceives whatever moves the Organs of the external Sen≈øes; this is only conver≈øant about things pre≈øent. It is Fancy or Imagination, as it perceives ≈øen≈øible Objects at a Time wherein they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the external Sen≈øes, and forms Images and Repre≈øentations of them, otherwi≈øe called Phanta≈øms. It is Memory, as by the Foot≈øteps of the Spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed upon the Brain, it is determined for Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. La≈øtly, The ≈øen≈øitive Appetite is the Soul, as upon occa≈øion of a certain Motion of the animal Spirits in the Brain, it is di≈øpo≈øed to have the≈øe Affections we call Pa≈ø≈øions, for in≈øtance, Love, De≈øire, Hope, Fear, Hatred, and the like: The Action al≈øo, whereby the Soul moves the Spirits, is really the Soul it ≈øelf.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII. </hi>Of animal Motion, and of the Species of natural Action.</head>
               <p>ANimal motion is a motion performed by the Will, whereby the animal Spirits which always run about the Brain are in readine≈øs for an influx, and pre≈øently flow into the beginnings of the Nerves, and there protrude the Spirits previou≈øly exi≈øting to the Mu≈øcle, which blow up the Fibres of it, and ≈øo make it ≈øhorter and more compact; and ≈øo the Member into which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted is moved.</p>
               <p>Natural Actions are various: The chief are the motion of the Heart, the Pul≈øe, the Circulation of the Blood, Re≈øpiration, Hunger, and Thir≈øt, Chylification, Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63575:32"/>the peri≈øtaltic Motion, Nutrition, Accreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Generation.</p>
               <p>The motion of the Heart is Mu≈øcular; for it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtringed on every part by the duct of the Fibres, it is le≈ø≈øened and grows hard in its motion, in the ≈øame manner other Mu≈øcles do. It is two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Dia≈øtole, in re≈øpect of which the Heart is meerly pa≈ø≈øive; and Contraction or Sy≈øtole, which is the action of the Heart.</p>
               <p>Both the Auricles of the Heart together, as the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of it, have their Sy≈øtole and Dia≈øtole; but the Sy≈øtole of them is the Dia≈øtole of the Ventricles; and ≈øo on the contrary. The Dia≈øtole of the Auricles does not ≈øo much depend on the rarefaction of the Blood, as the quantity of it; for the Blood is forced into them by great Veins. The Dia≈øtole was before the Sy≈øtole, or otherwi≈øe there would have been no Sy≈øtole; and it partly depends upon the quantity of the Blood, and partly upon the fermentation and rarefaction of it by ≈øome ≈øubtile matter in the Heart, whereby the ≈øides of the Heart are expanded. The Sy≈øtole of the Heart is made by the influx of the Animal Spirits.</p>
               <p>The Pul≈øe is an alternate dilatation and con≈øtriction of the Artery, by rea≈øon of the Bloods being forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Arteries. There are at lea≈øt two Thou≈øand Pul≈øes in an hours time, in every healthy Man, as any one may find by numbering them; but they are much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Pa≈ø≈øions of the Mind: They are quick in People that are angry, and in tho≈øe that are chearful; and when we are labouring and running: They are ≈ølower in ≈øuch as are ≈øorrowful fearful, and the like. In Children the Pul≈øe is quick, becau≈øe the Heart is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ≈øoon irritated, and their Arteries are ea≈øily dilated, and their Blood is thin, and ≈øoon rarifies.</p>
               <p>The Circulation of the Blood is a motion whereby the Blood continually flows thro' the Arteries from the Heart, and returns to it again by the Veins. This
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63575:33"/>Circulation of the Blood is ≈øo obvious, that none needs doubt of it; for in bleeding in the Arm, a Quart of Blood, yea, the whole Ma≈øs may be drawn away, and it cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed that ≈øo much Blood was contained in the Arm. Circulation al≈øo is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt from the Valves of the Veins, which are ≈øo di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed as to remit the Blood to the Heart, but not on the contrary.</p>
               <p>The manner of Circulation is as follows; the Blood is carried from the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> a≈øcending and de≈øcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the right Auricle of the Heart, and thence to the right Ventricle of the Heart, and after it has been rarified in this Ventricle, it is conveyed into the Artery of the Lungs, and from thence into the Vein of the Lungs, and the left Auricle of the Heart, and ≈øo into the left Ventricle of the Heart, and then, after another Rarefaction of it there, it is driven into the Arteria Aorta a≈øcending, and de≈øcending, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øper≈øed thro' the whole Body; and from thence again it is carried as before, thro' the corre≈øponding Branches of the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> into the right Auricle of the Heart immediately, by Ino≈øculation of the Branches, and Tran≈øudation from the Artery, into the adjoyning Vein, or mediately thro the middle Fle≈øh, betwixt the veiny and arterial Branches, and thro' the Sinus's and their Branches in the Brain, where the Blood is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øorbed from the Carotide and vertebral Arteries; and from the≈øe it is carried to the Juguiars.</p>
               <p>It is manife≈øt that the Blood circulates thro' the Fle≈øh, becau≈øe, when it is pre≈ø≈øed, it grows white, the Blood then flying away; but when that returns, it looks red as before. Moreover, in blu≈øhing, the Face looks red, the Blood flying to it. The Blood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Fle≈øh by the fine ≈øimple and porous Tunics of the capillary Arteries, or thro' the Extremities of them.</p>
               <p>In a Foetus the Blood is otherwi≈øe circulated; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in part, from the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> thro' the <hi>foramen
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63575:33"/>ovale,</hi> it pa≈ø≈øes into the Vein of the Lungs, nor does all pa≈øs thro' the right Ventricle of the Heart, but enters from the Artery of the Lungs into the Aorta, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branaceous Tube being ≈øtretched from that to this, and ≈øo it does not pa≈øs again thro' the left Ventricle of the Heart. Another part goes the ordinary way. This other Motion of the Blood is rather in a Foetus than tho≈øe that are born; in whom, after ≈øome Days, the ≈øaid Pa≈ø≈øages are ≈øhut.</p>
               <p>The End of Circulation is the Nutrition of the Parts, the heating of the Body, and the Generation of the vital and animal Spirits, and to pre≈øerve the Blood from Coagulation.</p>
               <p>A certain Time cannot be ≈øet for the Circulation of the Blood, for it is le≈øs in hot People than in cold; becau≈øe in the≈øe, by rea≈øon of a quicker Rarefaction of the Blood, the Heart is ≈øooner irritated to con≈øtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Blood is driven out. The Time is al≈øo le≈øs in ≈øuch as are in Motion, than in tho≈øe that are quiet; becau≈øe in ≈øuch, by a Contraction of the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the Ve≈ø≈øels are, by turns, more ≈øtraitned, and the Blood flows quicker. <hi>Lower</hi> thinks the Blood cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates in an Hour. The Quickne≈øs of the Circulation of the Blood appears hence, <hi>viz.</hi> if one of the Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide Arteries be only cut, all the Blood will flow out in the 12th. Part of an Hour, and if ≈øo, how ≈øoon would it run out if the Aorta were cut?</p>
               <p>Re≈øpiration is a Motion, whereby the Air is alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately drawn into the Lungs, and expelled out: It con≈øi≈øts of In≈øpiration and Expiration. In≈øpiration is partly made by the Dilatation of the Brea≈øt, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ela≈øtick Force of the Air, and partly by the Pre≈ø≈øure which it has from the Weight of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Atmo≈øphere. The Brea≈øt is dilated chiefly by the internal and external interco≈øtal Mu≈øcles. Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made by the Con≈øtriction of the Brea≈øt and Lungs, al≈øo by the Heat and Rarefaction of the Air in the Lungs.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63575:34"/>
               <p>Re≈øpiration is a ≈øpontaneous Action, becau≈øe it is perform'd when we know nothing of it, but it is it ≈øome ≈øort voluntary, becau≈øe we can quicken or retard it as we will.</p>
               <p>The chief End of Re≈øpiration is Voice; to perform which there is need of Air: Be≈øides, by this means ≈øome fuliginous and adu≈øt Particles are carried off. Tho≈øe who≈øe Lungs do not move freely, as crooked People, and the like, are ≈øubject to Con≈øumptions; becau≈øe their Lungs not being ≈øufficiently dilated and contracted, cannot well free them≈øelves from the fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous Vapours of the Blood, and other acrid and gro≈øs Particles, upon which account they are ≈øubject to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions, and at length to Corruption.</p>
               <p>Divers can continue under Water a notable while without breathing, becau≈øe they know how to fill them≈øelves with Air before, and becau≈øe they are le≈øs hot; but ≈øome ≈øay that they have a way of putting their Hands to their Mouth, and ≈øo to ≈øeparate the Air from the Water.</p>
               <p>Hy≈øteric Women are ≈øaid to live a long while without breathing, yet I ≈øuppo≈øe they do breath, tho the Standers by do not perceive it, or at lea≈øt, the Air pa≈ø≈øes of its own accord, into their Lungs, and out again, and this perhaps may ≈øuffice for them.</p>
               <p>The Motion of the Brain is the con≈øtant Motion of it made alternately by the Sy≈øtole and Dia≈øtole, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Sub≈øtance, and independent from the Meninges.</p>
               <p>Hunger is a trouble≈øome Sen≈øe of Vellication in the Stomach, whereby we are di≈øpo≈øed to crave for ≈øome ≈øolid thing to take it off. This Vellication proceeds from an Acid in the Stomach.</p>
               <p>We are more hungry in the Winter than in the Summer; becau≈øe then the Ferment of the Stomach is more acrid, and, by rea≈øon of le≈øs Tran≈øpiration, more plentiful.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:63575:34"/>
               <p>That an Acid is the Cau≈øe of Hunger is proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe Acids increa≈øe it, and re≈øtore it when it is lo≈øt, and tho≈øe things take it away, which de≈øtroy or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate an Acid; for in≈øtance, Crabs-eyes, Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn calcined, Pear's, fat things, Spirit of Wine, and the like: If Hunger be continued long, it at length le≈ø≈øens of its own accord, becau≈øe the Acid is dried up, or overwhelmed by other Humours drawn from the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Some think that Hunger is occa≈øioned by Suction, whereby the Veins ≈øuck from the Liver, the Liver from the Guts, the Guts from the Stomach; but this is ≈øo vain, that it is ≈øcarce worth refuting, for there is no Suction in the Parts, much le≈øs ≈øuch a continual one.</p>
               <p>Thir≈øt is a trouble≈øome Sen≈øe of Vellication in the Mouth and Jaws, whereby we are di≈øpo≈øed to crave for ≈øome liquid thing to take it off; the Cau≈øe is Sicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or a ≈øalt Humour or Vapour.</p>
               <p>We ≈øometimes put off Thir≈øt by holding in our Mouths a leaden Bullet, or the like, not becau≈øe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity flows from the≈øe, but becau≈øe, by the Motion of them and the Tongue, the ≈øalivary Ducts are more opened, and the Spittle flows out.</p>
               <p>Liquid things take off Thir≈øt, by moi≈øtening and diluting the ≈øaline Particles.</p>
               <p>Spirit of Wine quenches the Thir≈øt of Travellers at the Beginning, by opening the ≈øalivary Ducts, and by helping the Propul≈øion of Moi≈øture, but it afterwards increa≈øes it.</p>
               <p>Chilification is the Conver≈øion of Meat and Drink into Chile; it is chiefly made in the Stomach and Guts, but it begins in the Mouth.</p>
               <p>The efficient Cau≈øe of Chilification is partly Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but e≈øpecially ≈øome acid Humour. It is made in the following manner: Hard Meat is fir≈øt chewed by the Teeth, and often turned about in the Mouth by the Motion of the Tongue, and by the Jaws and Lips,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63575:35"/>and is moi≈øtened with Spittle, and then is conveyed to the Stomach, partly by the Weight of it, and partly by the Contraction of the annular Fibres of the Oefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus. If the Meat is ≈øolid, it is ≈ølowly di≈ø≈øolved in the Stomach; but if it is liquid, it is ≈øoon dige≈øted. The Stomach pre≈øently embraces the Meat on every ≈øide with its Fibres, and both its Orifices, at lea≈øt the upper, is ≈øomewhat contracted, but both of them are ≈øomewhat ≈øhut, even when the Stomach is empty, le≈øt any thing ≈øhould regurgitate from the Guts to the Mouth, or the indige≈øted Meat ≈øhould fall into the Guts. This Clo≈øure is made by many carnous and nervous Fibres, wherewith both Orifices are compo≈øed in the manner of a nervous and carnous Ring, the Meat being included in the Stomach, is impregnated with Spittle, and the acid Humour that ≈øweats out of the Sides of the Stomach, and ≈øometime after it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with the Spittle and an acid Humour, it becomes ≈øpongy and porous in the Stomach, becau≈øe now its Parts are fermented by ≈øubtle Matter; afterwards it appears torn into ≈ømall Pieces, and at length the whole is reduced to the Con≈øi≈øtence of Cream, and then Chylification is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed in the Stomach: But all Meat, and every Part of it does not turn to Chyle in the Stomach altogether: but the ≈øofter and finer, a little and well chewed is turned to Chyle ≈øoone≈øt, <hi>Caeteris paribus;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is eaten fir≈øt may not be fir≈øt dige≈øted, becau≈øe it may be gro≈ø≈øer and more vi≈øcid. Things boyled, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> are ≈øooner dige≈øted than ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted things, and ≈øuch things as are not ≈ømoaked, ≈øoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ≈øuch as are: Milk or Broath is dige≈øted in the Space of an Hour, and in a great mea≈øure di≈øtributed: Bread is pretty ≈øoon di≈ø≈øolved, ≈øo are Pot-herbs and Pul≈øe; but Fi≈øh and Fle≈øh require longer Time: That Meat which is di≈ø≈øolved, does not ≈øtay in the Stomach till all be ≈øo, but that which is fir≈øt di≈ø≈øolved is fir≈øt conveyed to the lower Orifice, and tran≈ømitted thro'
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63575:35"/>it. That this is ≈øo, the opening of many Dogs after eating, makes appear, and we judge that it is ≈øo in Men; but ≈øeeing Chylification is ≈øo various it cannot be limited to a certain Time, for ≈øome Peoples Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs are ≈øo ≈øtrong, that the Chyle is perfected in in three, four, or five Hours at mo≈øt; whereas on the contrary, the Stomach of ≈øome is ≈øo weak, that eight, ten, or thirteen Hours are required to perfect Chylification: But generally ≈øpeaking, ≈øeven Hours are ≈øufficient: But the certain Sign of Chylification is the craving after more Meat.</p>
               <p>A further Chylification and Fermentation are made in the Guts; for fir≈øt, the Chyle carries to the Guts from the Stomach, the dige≈øtive Humour well mixed with it, and new Spittle, and an acid Humour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ≈ølow to the Stomach, and ≈øo a new ferment of it is continually generated, and pa≈ø≈øes from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to the Chyle expelled; yea, it is probable, that ≈øome acid Humour continually flows from the Me≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raick Arteries, as in the Stomach, upon all the Guts that are near it.</p>
               <p>Dige≈øtion is better made in the Night when we ≈øleep than in the Day when we are awake, at lea≈øt the A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption being equal, and other things alike; for in Sleep, the Blood and Spirits, being not ≈øo much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the external Parts of the Body, the Stomach receives more Acid and Heat, and is the more nearly contracted, and ≈øo the better embraces the Meat; and con≈øequently the Supper, which is contrary to Cu≈øtom now adays, ought to be a fuller Meal than the Dinner; and tho' the Time betwixt Dinner and Supper, is le≈øs than betwixt the Supper and the next Days Dinner, yet you mu≈øt know, that that which is eaten at a large Dinner, is often not fully dige≈øted before Supper, and ≈øo the Stomach has a double Task.</p>
               <p>Chylification is al≈øo better in Winter than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and therefore we are ≈øooner hungry in Winter,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63575:36"/>we eat more, and grow fat; and this Rea≈øon confirms, becau≈øe in Winter the Acid of the Stomach being le≈øs re≈øolved, abounds more.</p>
               <p>Sanguification is the Conver≈øion of Chyle into Blood; this is done in the whole Body, but e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Heart, and in the left Ventricle of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Particles of Chyle are much rarified and agitated with the Particles of the Blood.</p>
               <p>The Cau≈øe of Sanguification is our Heat or natural Fire, which remaining after the foregoing Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood in the Heart, in≈øinuates it ≈øelf pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Pores of the other Blood coming into the Heart, mixed with the Chyle, in the Pa≈ø≈øage whereof, when it meets with ≈øome Particles that di≈øagree with it, Fermentation ari≈øes among the Particles of the Chyle, and with the Blood in the Heart and Arteries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are le≈ø≈øened by degrees, rendred flexible, and di≈øpo≈øed to Redne≈øs.</p>
               <p>That Heat is the Cau≈øe of Redne≈øs, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Author of Sanguification, none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who ≈øees Quinces, that before were white, Beer, and other things, to grow red by boyling, and that ≈øome chymical Liquors poured upon one another fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and become red.</p>
               <p>But there are ≈øome, notwith≈øtanding, will not have Sanguification to be made by any Fermentation in the Heart, denying that the Blood is ≈øo rarified and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Heart by a ≈øubtle Matter, for the≈øe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons; Fir≈øt, becau≈øe in this ca≈øe ≈øo great a Quantity of Blood would fall upon the Ventricles of the Heart, as would endanger the breaking of them. Secondly, Becau≈øe the Blood does not ≈øtay a ≈øufficient Time in the Heart for ≈øuch a Rarefaction, and if it were put upon a Fire, it would not rarifie ≈øo ≈øoon. Thirdly, that the Heart being pricked, the Blood comes out frothy. To the fir≈øt I an≈øwer, that ≈øo much Blood does not enter into the Ventricles, as to fill them with its Quantity; for the Auricles, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63575:36"/>are as it were the Mea≈øures of the Ventricles, are not ≈øo great; be≈øides, the fle≈øhy Walls of them have their Expan≈øibility, to which, when they are extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Heart is irritated, and pre≈øently contracts, and ≈øo there is no Danger of a Rupture. To the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond I an≈øwer, that it ought not to continue long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Blood is in a manner previou≈øly endued with ≈øufficient Heat, as we ≈øee Milk rarified, being removed from the Fire, ≈øub≈øides a little, and being put on again, pre≈øently rarifies more; and the rea≈øon why Blood does not rarifie ≈øo ≈øoon on the Fire as in the Heart, is becau≈øe the ≈øubtle Matter, whereby it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to rarifie, is lo≈øt, when the Blood is drawn out. To the third I an≈øwer, that this may be, becau≈øe ≈øo ≈øoon as it comes out of the Heart, much of the ≈øubtle Matter flies away; and therefore, upon the whole, we ≈øuppo≈øe, that Sanguification is perfected in us by Fermentation.</p>
               <p>The peri≈øtaltick Motion of the Guts is a Motion whereby the Stomach and Guts are continually and ≈øucce≈ø≈øively ≈øtraightened from the Beginning to the End, and creep among≈øt them≈øelves like Worms. This is proved by our con≈øtantly ≈øeeing it in the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øection of living Animals. Perhaps ≈øome will ≈øay, that this is a Convul≈øion and preternatural, but I think this ought not to be ≈øu≈øpected, becau≈øe it al≈øo appears in a Dog, a very ≈ømall Apertion of the Belly being only made, which may be done by le≈øs Pain than will cau≈øe a Convul≈øion, e≈øpecially if the Dog be young. Be≈øides, tho≈øe annular and carnous Fibres in the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks of the Inte≈øtines, that have ≈øo many Nerves, ≈øhew the ≈øame; al≈øo the Protru≈øion of the Chyle and Faeces thro' the Guts, which would be otherwi≈øe very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, by rea≈øon of ≈øo many Turnings and Windings, and ≈øo be the Cau≈øe of Putrefaction, and ≈ølow Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:63575:37"/>
               <p>This Motion is made by a ≈øucce≈ø≈øive Inflation, and Contraction of the annular Fibres, by the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and al≈øo by the Retraction of the right Fibres.</p>
               <p>Nutrition is the Conver≈øion of the Aliment into the Sub≈øtance of the living Body, whereby the living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to all its integral Parts, keeps propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the ≈øame Quantity; and therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtauration ought to be preci≈øely as much, as the Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution is.</p>
               <p>Nutrition is nece≈ø≈øary to all Animals, not only in re≈øpect of the Augmentation of their Parts, while they are little Embryo's, but al≈øo in re≈øpect of their Con≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation after, during Life; becau≈øe their Bodies being in a natural Con≈øumption, or Exhau≈øtion, would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably be ≈øoon re≈øolved into their fir≈øt Elements, unle≈øs the Providence of Nature had ordained a continual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation or Reparation of Parts, by Sub≈øtitution, and A≈ø≈øimulation of fre≈øh Matter in the room of tho≈øe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles di≈øper≈øed and con≈øumed.</p>
               <p>The efficient Cau≈øe of the perpetual Con≈øumption of our Bodies, ≈øeems to be what all Philo≈øophers unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou≈øly hold it to be, the vital Heat of the Blood, therein fir≈øt kindled, by the pla≈øtick Spirit continually renewed by the vital Spirit, and by the Arteries dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed to all Parts of the Body, that they may thereby be warmed, cheri≈øhed, and enlivened. This vital Heat continually glowing within us, and principally in the Ventricles of the Heart, con≈øi≈øting in a certain Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the various Particles of the Blood, and in ≈øome Degree, analogous to Fire or Flame, I cannot conceive how it is po≈ø≈øible for it to ≈øub≈øi≈øt or continue, for ≈øo much as one Moment of Time, unle≈øs it be maintained by convenient Fuel, which is thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øantly fed upon, and by degrees con≈øumed, for it is of the Nature of all Fire, how gentle, or mild ≈øoever, to generate and con≈øerve it ≈øelf, only by preying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and de≈øtroying the Matter wherein it is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63575:37"/>This vital Heat therefore, without Intermi≈ø≈øion, agitating, di≈ø≈øolving, and con≈øuming the minute and mo≈øt ea≈øily ex≈øoluble Particles of the Body, mu≈øt be the efficient Cau≈øe of the perpetual Con≈øumption of our Bodies; ≈øo that in truth we have one and the ≈øame Cau≈øe both of our Life, and of our Death; and to ≈øpeak more properly, our very Life is nothing but a continual Death, and we live becau≈øe we die; for we live ≈øo long, as while this internal ve≈øtal Heat is kept glowing in the Blood, and when it cea≈øes to glow, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of convenient Su≈øtenance, or by violent Suffocation, the Life is in≈øtantly extingui≈øhed.</p>
               <p>The Matter con≈øumed, I humbly conceive to be, for the greate≈øt part, the fluid Parts of the Body, chiefly the Blood and Spirits which are mo≈øt ea≈øily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoluble, and ≈øomewhat, tho' but little of the Sub≈øtance al≈øo of the ≈øolid Parts; for Experience teaches, that divers Animals, Bears, Dormice, Swallows, and the like, ≈øleep the whole Winter, without receiving any Supply of Aliment, and yet have all the ≈øolid Parts of their Bodies as large and firm, when they awake again in the Spring, as when they fir≈øt betook them≈øelves to their Dens and Dormitories, and the rea≈øon hereof ≈øeems to be this, that their vital Heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that time calm and gentle, con≈øumes their Blood and Spirits but ≈ølowly, and very little of their ≈øolid Parts, as a Lamp burns long, when the Oyl that ≈øeeds it is much, and the Flame but little and calm. We have Examples al≈øo of Leucophlegmatic Virgins; who, from a gradual Decay of Appetite, have fallen at length into an ab≈øolute Aver≈øion from all Food, and endured long Ab≈øtinence without either Miracle or Impo≈øture, and yet notwith≈øtanding, have not been emaciated in Proportion to the Time of their fa≈øting; whence it is probable, that in our Bodies there is not ≈øo rapid and profu≈øe an Expence, or Exhau≈øtion of the Sub≈øtance of the ≈øolid Parts, as heretofore many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63575:38"/>Phy≈øicians have imagined to be made by the Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the vital Heat.</p>
               <p>It is difficult, if not impo≈ø≈øible, to make an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Computation of the dayly Expences of this vital Heat; for ≈øo great is the Difference among Men, in re≈øpect of Temperament, Diet, Age, Exerci≈øe, the Sea≈øon of the Year, and various other Circum≈øtances, that a definite Calculation cannot be made of this Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øe, no not in tho≈øe who keep to the ≈øtricte≈øt Rules of an a≈øcetic Life, weighing them≈øelves and their Meat and Drink, as <hi>Cornaro</hi> is repored to have done dayly. We may indeed conjecture, from the ≈øtatic Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> that the Expence is great, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, if fourty Pounds of Meat and Drink be ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed ≈øufficient to maintain a Man of middle Stature, ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and of good Health, for ten Days, and about twenty Pounds be a≈ø≈øigned to the Excrements voided by Stool and Urine in that Time, the other twenty Pounds may be rea≈øonably a≈øcribed to in≈øen≈øible Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiration; but ≈øtill this is meer Conjecture.</p>
               <p>As to the Re≈øtauration, the efficient Principle is certainly the very ≈øame with the generant or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; becau≈øe Generation cannot be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Augmentation, and Augmentation is Nutrition: And I conceive, that Life con≈øi≈øts in, and depends upon a continual Generation of the vital Spirits out of the mo≈øt ≈øubtle, active, and volatile Parts of the Blood, and that Nutrition con≈øi≈øts in Reparation of what is con≈øumed by Appo≈øition and A≈ø≈øimulation of con≈øimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and congenerous Matter. The material or con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Principle I take to be a certain mild, ≈øweet, and bal≈øamic Liquor, analogous to the White of an Egg, and they are mi≈øtaken, who think that the Parts of the Body, being in Sub≈øtance diver≈øe, the Parts of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment al≈øo ought to be equally diver≈øe, as if Nutrition were really nothing but Selection, and ≈øimular Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of convenient Aliment, and that there were not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63575:38"/>required in every ≈øingle Part, a Concoction, A≈ø≈øimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Appo≈øition, and Tran≈ømutation of one Matter common to all; for fir≈øt, it is a difficult Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether there be in Nature any ≈øuch thing as Attraction or not, and to prove ≈øimular Attraction is yet more difficult, ≈øo that the very Foundation of this Opinion is meerly precarious. Moreover, it is evident, that the Aliment common to all the Parts, is ≈øimular, not heterogeneous, it being the proper Work of the pla≈øtic Power ≈øtill remaining in every Animal, as to form all the various Parts out of the ≈øame homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Matter at fir≈øt, ≈øo to augment and repair them all during Life, out of like Matter, by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that into the Sub≈øtance of every Part, which is indeed potentially all Parts, but actually none, as out of the ≈øame Rain-Water all ≈øorts of Plants receive their Nouri≈øhment.</p>
               <p>As to the manner how this homogeneous Matter is by the pla≈øtic Power accommodated to the Refection of all the various Parts of the Body; mo≈øt probable it is, that this admirable Work is gradually done by Di≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, Appo≈øition, Affixion, or Agglutination, and A≈ø≈øimulation, or Tran≈ømutation; all which Acts mu≈øt be ≈øucce≈ø≈øively performed, before the Operation can be compleat; for the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi> being prepared fir≈øt in the Stomach and Guts, and then in other Parts, to that end ordained, mu≈øt be di≈øtributed, brought home, and apponed to all Parts, that need Refection; then from Contiguity by Appo≈øition, it mu≈øt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Continuity by Affiction or Agglutination, and in fine, made of the ≈øame Sub≈øtance with each Part by A≈ø≈øimulation or Tran≈ømutation, which is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or ultimate Term of Nutrition.</p>
               <p>Generation is a Production of Nature, whereby one living Creature is formed in the Similitude of another.</p>
               <p>Generation is performed in the following manner, the virile Seed is injected into the Sheath of the Womb,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63575:39"/>and from thence is elevated a certain ≈øeminal Air or Spirit, which flies thro' the inner Mouth of the Womb, to the Bottom of it, and thence to the Fallopian Tubes, and ≈øo to the Te≈øticles or <hi>Ovaria</hi> of the Woman. Some think that the mo≈øt ≈øpirituous Portion of the Seed is imbibed by the Sub≈øtance of the Womb, and ≈øo conveyed with the Blood, to the <hi>Ovaria,</hi> to fecundate them: But our way is the ea≈øier and ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, at the ≈øame time the Woman, by rea≈øon of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and Titulation, is wont to emit a certain ≈øerous Humour, which may conduce to Conception, tho' it be not Seed, by diluting and rarifying the virile Seed, and by rendring the Separation of the ≈øeminal Spirit more ea≈øie, and by elevating it to the <hi>Ovaria,</hi> and ≈øo the ≈øeminal Air being rai≈øed from the virile Seed, that which is gro≈øs remains in the Sheath, is di≈ø≈øipated and ≈ølides out; and that we are generated by this ≈øeminal Air, and not by gro≈øs Seed, may be proved by Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetation, or new Conception in tho≈øe that are with Child; for in ≈øuch the Mouth of the Womb is clo≈øe ≈øhut, ≈øo that nothing but a Spirit can pa≈øs. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this may be proved by ≈øome that generate, tho by rea≈øon of the Brevity and Debility of the <hi>Penis,</hi> never ca≈øt their Seed into the Bottom of the Womb, which certainly cou'd not be, if the Air alone of it were not ≈øufficient for Generation; and do we not ≈øee that a Cock generates without the Ejection of Seed, and meerly, as I may ≈øay, by touching the Fundament of the Hen with a moi≈øtened <hi>Penis,</hi> and yet this Place is far di≈øtant from the <hi>Ovaria</hi> in a Hen; what therefore can conduce to the breeding of Eggs, may con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Generation of Men? This ≈øeminal Air there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being conveyed from the Bottom of the Womb thro' the Fallopian Tubes, into the <hi>Ovaria,</hi> there in≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates it ≈øelf into one Egg or more, as they are nearer to its Entrance, or more di≈øpo≈øed to receive and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh it; and hence it is, why all the Eggs are not fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundated
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63575:39"/>at once, and ordinarily but a few; and why not always at the fir≈øt Congre≈øs. The Eggs are be≈øt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundated, when a Woman is neare≈øt the Time of her Cour≈øes, by rea≈øon of the greater Poro≈øity of her Womb and Te≈øticles, whereby the ≈øeminal Air is the ea≈øier received into the Eggs. The Eggs are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in membranous Cups like Acorns, and indeed very loo≈øly, ≈øo that they may be expelled out of them by the Breath only. The fecundated Egg being turgid and rarified by the ≈øeminal Spirit, can no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ≈øelf in its Cup, but falls from it of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord into the Fallopian Tube, and from thence, by a ≈øucce≈ø≈øive Con≈øtriction of all the Fibres, it is forced into the Bottom of the Womb.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX. </hi>Of things nonnatural in general.</head>
               <p>THings nonnatural are things nece≈ø≈øary for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of Health, but hurt it when ill apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ≈øuch are the ambient Air, Meat and Drink, Sleep and Watching, Motion and Re≈øt, things to be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and retained. The≈øe things indifferently do good or Hurt, as they are well or ill applyed: But we mu≈øt under≈øtand, that what is good for one, may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for another, according to the Nature and Cu≈øtom in divers People, whereunto much is to be attributed in the U≈øe of nonnatural things; yea, the ≈øame thing may do good at one time, and hurt at another.</p>
               <p>We do not con≈øider Air here ≈øimply and by it ≈øelf, but as it encompa≈ø≈øes us, that is, as it has various Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu≈øcles mixed with it, and as it can affect us with them: But it generally affects our Bodies, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin≈øically, that is, by in≈øinuating it ≈øelf into the Pores
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63575:40"/>of the Skin, or intrin≈øically being breathed in; and either way variou≈øly, as it is by it ≈øelf diver≈øe, or by being mixed with other things, ≈øo if there is much Water mixed with it, it may moi≈øten us much, and if it be very ≈øubtle, it may heat us much, and if it be mixed with narcotic things, as in ≈øome places it is, it may make us drow≈øy, yea, induce a deadly Sleep: If it be infected with a pe≈øtilential Contagion, or with any other ill thing, it may occa≈øion the Plague, or ≈øome other Di≈øea≈øe.</p>
               <p>It is di≈øputed by ≈øome, whether Air or Aliment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects us mo≈øt; but becau≈øe the manner of both is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe, it cannot be ≈øo exactly judged of, yet it is certain, we are much affected by both, and indeed more conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by the Air, than Aliment; for we can ≈øcarce continue a Moment without Air, for unle≈øs it attempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Heat of the Blood, it will be ≈øoon choaked; but we are more ≈øen≈øibly and vehemently affected with Aliment, by rea≈øon of the Gro≈ø≈øne≈øs and Den≈øity of it.</p>
               <p>If you ask what Air is mo≈øt proper for the Pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Health, I ≈øay, a pure and limpid Air, that is ventilated with whole≈øome Winds, and free from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty Exhalations, from Carca≈øes. and Sinks, and the like; and ≈øuch an one I judge proper for any healthy Man: But when any Quality exceeds its contrary, it requires an Air that is exce≈ø≈øive in the contrary, ≈øo a hot Air is proper for a Man that is very cold, and cold Air for one that is very hot, and for Diver≈øity of Ages, Diver≈øity of Air is proper, for with them the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is changed, and therefore with the virile Age, which is mo≈øt temperate and perfect, a temperate Air be≈øt agrees.</p>
               <p>To the Air are to be reduced Winds, Regions, and Stats, for by the≈øe the State of the Air is much chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Wind is nothing el≈øe than the Air, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Exhalations and Vapours adhering to it, agitated about the Earth, the Wind is u≈øeful in moving
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63575:40"/>the Air about, and thereby pre≈øerving it from Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and it di≈ø≈øipates Filth that is mixed with the Air. Sailers reckon twenty four Winds, ≈øome twelve, others 16; but the chief of them are tho≈øe four which are called Cardinal, namely, the North, which is cold and dry, the South, which is hot and moi≈øt, the Ea≈øt, which is hot and dry, the We≈øt, which is cold and moi≈øt. The South Wind is the mo≈øt unwhole≈øome, becau≈øe it occa≈øions a Dullne≈øs of the Sen≈øes, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens all the Actions and Parts. The North is al≈øo bad, next to that the We≈øt, but the be≈øt of all is the Ea≈øt, e≈øpecially breathing in a Morning, for then it is purer, becau≈øe it breaths from a Place where the Sun is. The We≈øt is al≈øo good, if it blow in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>A Region is a Part of Earth, where there is a great Difference in the fir≈øt Qualities, by rea≈øon of a more right or oblique Motion of the Sun-beams. Regions are chiefly five, <hi>viz.</hi> the Aequinoctial placed under the Zodiack, the North lying in a Space betwixt the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Cancer</hi> and the Arctick Pole, the Meridian in the Space betwixt <hi>Capricorn</hi> and the Antarctick Pole, the Oriental and the Occidental.</p>

               <p>MEat is a ≈øolid and gro≈øs Aliment, that chiefly takes off Hunger; it is ≈øaid chiefly, becau≈øe the thinner Part of it may quench Thir≈øt, as thick Drink may appea≈øe Hunger. How great the Nece≈ø≈øity of both is, and how ea≈øily we are hurt by them, every one knows.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:63575:41"/>
               <p>All Aliment is either taken from Plants or Animals, but that nouri≈øhes le≈øs than this, becau≈øe this has a Matter more agreeable to ours; namely, of almo≈øt the ≈øame Aliment and Chyle, and more agreeable to our Parts and Pores; and therefore ea≈øier adheres to them. Minerals do not nouri≈øh, becau≈øe they have Parts too much di≈øagreeable to ours, and cannot adhere to them, by rea≈øon of their Rigidity; but indeed, Chymi≈øts ≈øay, that <hi>aurum potabile</hi> protracts Life; but if this be true, it does it upon another account, and not by non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhing; namely, by ≈øtrengthening the Blood, and di≈øcu≈ø≈øing its ≈øuperfluous Humidity, and by rai≈øing the languid Heat in old Men.</p>
               <p>Some Meat is of good Juice, that is, nouri≈øhes much; ≈øome of ill Juice; ≈øome is ea≈øily dige≈øted, ≈øome more difficultly; and ≈øome is ea≈øily corrupted in the Stomach, other not, and of tho≈øe which are ea≈øily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted, and of tho≈øe which are not ea≈øily dige≈øted, ≈øome are of good Juice, ≈øome not: All Meat that ≈øoon di≈ø≈øolves, ≈øoon nouri≈øhes; but all of it does not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh much, becau≈øe it may be of an improper Juice; for ≈øuch things as nouri≈øh much, ought to participate of Gro≈øne≈øs and Vi≈øco≈øity, which, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> are ≈ølower di≈ø≈øolved.</p>
               <p>Meat of the be≈øt Juice, of ea≈øie Dige≈øtion, and of the fewe≈øt Excrements, is be≈øt, and the contrary wor≈øt.</p>
               <p>Bread is made of various Corn, but the be≈øt of good Wheat well fermented before, whereof the fine≈øt is called White-bread, made of the fine≈øt Meal, the pure≈øt, ≈øofte≈øt, and lighte≈øt, and freed from all the Bran, and this is mo≈øt nouri≈øhing. The next Degree is not free from all the Bran, but only from the gro≈ø≈øer. Hou≈øhold Bread has all the Bran and Flower mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether confu≈øedly. There is al≈øo a ≈øort of Bread that is cour≈øer, which con≈øi≈øts more of Bran than of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this nouri≈øhes lae≈øt. Among all the≈øe Kinds,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63575:41"/>the Hou≈øhold-bread is the mo≈øt whole≈øome; becau≈øe, by rea≈øon of the Bran joined with it, it does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct ≈øo much, and loo≈øens the Belly, and moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nouri≈øhes; but the fine≈øt, and the next Sort, cau≈øe Ob≈øtructions by their Vi≈øcidity, the cour≈øe≈øt nouri≈øhes lea≈øt, but more or le≈øs, according to the Bran: This is mo≈øt u≈øed by poor People, and ≈øo is Rye-bread, which is harder, black, and offends the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Of the Fle≈øh of four-footed Bea≈øts, Veal is the be≈øt, next to that Mutton and Kid; of Fowl, Chicken, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Pidgeons, Patridges; of Sea Fi≈øh, Cod-fi≈øh; of River Fi≈øh, a Pearch, a Gudgeon, a Pike. Of tho≈øe things that come from Animals, Eggs and Milk are the be≈øt; of Fruits, Rai≈øins and Figs: But the≈øe that are ≈øaid to be the be≈øt and mo≈øt healthful, are not good for every body, nor does any agree with every body; but every one mu≈øt find out what be≈øt agrees with him: For tho≈øe that have a good Stomach, or labour much, as Country-men, Soldiers, and Sailers, Beef and Pork is be≈øt, becau≈øe they want a ≈øolid and gro≈øs Blood, which nouri≈øhes much, and does not ≈øo ≈øoon wa≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fi≈øh are ≈øu≈øpected by many, but unde≈øervedly; for they make good Blood of a moderate Con≈øi≈øtence, and are ea≈øily dige≈øted.</p>
               <p>The manner in eating ought to be ≈øuch, that the gro≈øs ought to be eat fir≈øt; for though I ≈øuppo≈øe that there is a Confu≈øion of all things taken into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and that the Order of A≈ø≈øumption does not continue long, yet the gro≈ø≈øer being taken fir≈øt, may be ≈øooner worked upon by the Acid of the Stomach. We ought to eat when we are hungry, and when the Stomach is empty; but ≈øome are hungry when their Stomachs are full, by rea≈øon of too great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Acid, and in this Ca≈øe the Hunger mu≈øt not be taken off by Meats, becau≈øe it is not natural.</p>
               <p>I cannot ≈øay in general how often we ought to eat in a Day, for ≈øuch as are cholerick may eat three or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63575:42"/>four times a Day moderately; ≈øuch as are phlegmatic may eat once a Day, becau≈øe they bear Hunger better, and do not con≈øume ≈øo much Blood. Such as are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy may eat twice or thrice a Day. We ought to eat ≈øo much at a time as will take off Hunger without burthening the Stomach, or ≈øo much as the Stomach can concoct without leaving Crudities behind it; the Quantity of the Meat is to be varied according to the Con≈øtitution, Strength, and Age; ≈øo one Quantity is proper for Youth, another for Age, another for a weak Man, another for a ≈øtrong Man, another for a healthy Man, another for a ≈øick Man, another for a cholerick Man, another for a flegmatic Man, and ≈øuch a Quantity for one that exerci≈øes his Body, and le≈øs for one that exerci≈øes his Mind: But it is better to eat ≈øomewhat too much than too little; and therefore it is better to indulge the Appetite ≈øomewhat, for ≈øo the Stomach will be accu≈øtomed to bear ≈øometimes ≈ømall Exce≈ø≈øes, and to concoct ≈øomething more.</p>
               <p>And as the Quantity of Meats ought to be adapted to the Con≈øtitutions, ≈øo the Quality ought to be ≈øo too, according to the Diver≈øity of Tempers, Age, Time, and Cu≈øtom; ≈øo tho≈øe that are hot and dry ought to u≈øe cooling and moi≈øtening Diet, ≈øo Children require more tender Diet than Youths or Men, and a cooler Diet ought to be u≈øed in Summer than in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Meats boyled ≈øooner turn to Chyle than ro≈øted Meat; but ro≈øted Meat nouri≈øhes more, becau≈øe it more abounds with nutritive Juice, as may be ≈øeen by cutting it with a Knife; for the hard Cru≈øt without keeps in the Gravey, which is di≈øper≈øed in the Broath of boyled Meat; therefore ro≈øted Meat is mo≈øt proper for Labourers, and boyled Meat for tho≈øe that live a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary Life.</p>
               <p>Drink is a thin and liquid Aliment, chiefly u≈øed to quench Thir≈øt. The chiefe≈øt kind of Drinks are Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Wine, and Beer. It is di≈øputed concerning Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63575:42"/>whether it nouri≈øhes; but I ≈øay it nouri≈øhes; for it is not a ≈øimple Element, and many Men live pretty well that drink only Water, and ≈øeem to be refre≈øhed by it; and we ≈øee that Water alone nouri≈øhes a long while, and that Fi≈øh increa≈øe, being kept in Troughs; and ≈øo Plants and Fruits are nouri≈øhed by Water. There are many Species of Water, there is Rain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Well-water, Fountain-water, Lake-water, Snow-water, and Ice-water. The be≈øt Water is that which is limpid and Sweet, or rather without any Ta≈øte or Colour, ≈øo that the Goodne≈øs of Water is to be judged of by the Ab≈øence of Colour, Ta≈øte, and Smell. Some think that the lighte≈øt Water is be≈øt, but this is not to be judged of by the Scale; for often ill Water weighs le≈øs than good; but the meaning is, it ≈øits lighter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stomach and Bowels. Fountain-water is the be≈øt, if it be ≈øtrained thro' good Earth; next to it Rain-water, which is lighter, thinner, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but is wor≈øe, by rea≈øon of diver≈øe Vapours and Exhalations, which are mixed with it. Well-water is very unwhole≈øome, becau≈øe it is counted to ≈øtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and is not agitated by the Rayes of the Sun, and if the Well be covered, it is much wor≈øe That which is taken out of the mid≈øt of a River is better, if it be clear, and if the Stream be rapid. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Lake is very ill, by rea≈øon of the Stagnation. Wor≈øt of all is Ice or Snow-Water; for it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and crude. In ≈øhort, the be≈øt is the pure, clear, and ≈øubtle Water; which being ≈øet on the Fire, ≈øoon heats, and taken thence, is ≈øoon cool. Let the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be ≈øituate towards the Ea≈øt, and run to the North. The Water which runs on pure Earth is better than ≈øuch as runs upon Stones.</p>
               <p>It is good for hot, fat, and fle≈øhy Men, and mixed with Wine for ≈øuch as u≈øe much Labour and Exerci≈øe: And tho' it does not nouri≈øh much, yet it refre≈øhes, and is a Vehicle for the Food; it excites Appetite, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63575:43"/>opportunely given in burning Fevers, it does good; for it is very contrary to the Nature of a Fever, for it refre≈øhes and moi≈øtens the Body; but it is bad for ≈øuch as have weak Stomachs, and that are troubled with Convul≈øions. Ill Water is corrected by beaten Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or with Ani≈øe-≈øeeds, and for ≈øick Men boyl there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Cinnamon, and the like. Honey-Water or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin has great Vertues, it takes away Thir≈øt, cures cold Infirmities of the Brain, Nerves, and Joints. It is good again≈øt Coughs, cuts and expells gro≈øs Flegm, moves the Body, and purges the Pa≈ø≈øages of the Urine.</p>
               <p>Wine is expre≈ø≈øed from the Grape. There are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Differences of it according to the Colour, Smell, Gro≈ø≈øne≈øs, Tenuity, and Age. Wine is hot and dry; the be≈øt Wine is that which ta≈øtes rough, and ≈øweeti≈øh. Sweet Wine nouri≈øhes much, is a Friend to the Brea≈øt, but ≈øoon increa≈øes Choler: Rough Wine, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is injurious to the Brea≈øt, and binds much: Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Wine refre≈øhes the Spirits much, but afterwards it di≈øorders the Head. Yellow Wine is hotter than white; it is aperitive, and forces Urine. Red Wine ≈øtrengthens the Stomach, and other Parts, and makes laudable Blood; but if it be gro≈øs, it breeds gro≈øs Blood, nouri≈øhes more, and cau≈øes Ob≈øtructions. That which is thin is more aperitive than that which is gro≈øs, it ≈øooner pa≈ø≈øes, and does not nouri≈øh ≈øo much. New Wine is not ≈øo hot as old, but generates Wind, unle≈øs it loo≈øen the Belly. Old Wine di≈øturbs the Head: Rheni≈øh Wine, by rea≈øon of its great Tenuity and Crudity, ≈øtirs up the Humours into a Flux, and ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates them from the Ma≈øs, and occa≈øions the Gout.</p>
               <p>Of all the Liquors we drink, Wine may ju≈øtly claim the Superiority; for it is more whole≈øome, and by rea≈øon of its ≈øubtle and penetrating Sub≈øtance, it mixes better with the Ma≈øs than Water and other Drinks: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, it is very plea≈øant and grateful to the Pallate, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtores the radical Moi≈øture, and chears the Heart, and is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63575:43"/>the mo≈øt certain Prop and Maintainance of our Life; and therefore our Fore-fathers called the Vine <hi>Vitis, qua≈øi vita,</hi> as if it were the Tree of Life: But the U≈øe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be regulated by the≈øe 12 following In≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; 1≈øt. When the Wine is ≈øtrong and full of Spirit, we mu≈øt always mix Water therewith; 2dly. Never drink Wine after Dinner nor Supper, till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Food be ended; for then it helps Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment, penetrating more ea≈øily the Body; whereas at fir≈øt it will hinder Dige≈øtion. 3dly. You mu≈øt have a care that you do not drink Wine cooled with Snow or Ice-Water, for it is very pernicious to the Brain, Sinews, Brea≈øt, Stomach, Kidneys, and Bladder. 4thly. You mu≈øt avoid drinking Wine fa≈øting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it troubles the Under≈øtanding, occa≈øions the Cramp, and is exceeding hurtful to the Brain and Nerves. 5thly. It is not convenient to drink a large Quantity of thin Wine after moi≈øt Fruit. 6thly. If at the ≈øame Table both ≈øtrong and ≈ømall Wine are u≈øed, begin with the ≈ømall, re≈øerving the ≈øtrong for the la≈øt, which comforts the Mouth of the Stomach, and helps Dige≈øtion. 7thly. By how much the Food is more cold and gro≈øs, by ≈øo much the more need is there of ≈øtrong Wine: But when the Food is more ≈øubtle, hot, and dige≈øtable, let the Wine be weak; and therefore ≈øuch as feed on Beef and Fi≈øh are to drink ≈øtronger Wine than ≈øuch as feed on Pullets, and the like. 8thly. Such as u≈øe much Wine, ought not to eat much, for Wine ≈øerves in≈øtead of Meat and Drink; and therefore Nature cannot ea≈øily dige≈øt them both. 9thly. Wine that is weaken'd with Water is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomer than that which is naturally weak; for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more ea≈øily putrifies. 10thly. Such as have a weak Brain and hot Stomach, and dwell in ≈øultry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ought to drink a little Wine, mixing Water therewith: But if cold, more Wine and le≈øs Water will not be ami≈øs. 11thly. You mu≈øt ob≈øerve the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63575:44"/>of the Year, for in Winter drink very ≈øparingly, but ≈øtrong Wine; in Summer more largely, but ≈ømall and mixed with Water. 12thly. You mu≈øt con≈øider the Age, for as Wine is very bad for Children, ≈øo it is mo≈øt proper for old Men, ≈øeeing that it qualifies and allays their cold Complexion; and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Wine to Children, gives young Men leave to drink it moderately, and allows old Men a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful U≈øe thereof, ≈øaying, that young Men, before they are twenty two Years old ought not to drink any Wine, becau≈øe that will add Fire to their Fire.</p>
               <p>Good Wine ought to be clean, pure, and clear; it mu≈øt be of an excellent Odour, for ≈øuch Wines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe the ≈øubtle Spirits, nouri≈øh excellently, and breed good Blood; it mu≈øt ta≈øte plea≈øantly, but mo≈øt not be ≈øharp nor ≈øweet; for if ≈øweet, it inflames, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructs, and fills the Head; if ≈øharp or ≈øowre, it hurts the Nerves and Stomach, and begets Crudities.</p>
               <p>Wine, if u≈øed di≈øcreetly and moderately, does communicate innumerable Benefits, both to Body and Mind; for as to the Mind, it is rendered more ≈øecure and calm, the Spirits are ≈øtrengthened, and dilate them≈øelves, Joy and Gladne≈øs are augmented, ≈øad and unplea≈øant Thoughts are bani≈øhed; it clears the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding, excites the Wit, takes away Melancholy, incourages the Spirits, and enlivens them; it is very nouri≈øhing, re≈øi≈øts Putrefaction, helps Dige≈øtion, and breeds good Blood, cuts Flegm, expels Wind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Sleep, excites Appetite, fattens healthy Men, opens Ob≈øtructions, concocts crude Humours, and is the <hi>Theriaca magna</hi> of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>New Wine is of difficult Dige≈øtion, offends the Bowels, cau≈øes Wind and the Bloody Flux.</p>
               <p>Old Wine is hot and dry, and the older it is, the more Heat it acquires. The be≈øt is odoriferous and full of Spirits: It is naught for Copulation, becau≈øe it dries up the Seed. It is naught for young Men and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63575:44"/>cholerick Per≈øons; but good for old Men, e≈øpecially in the Winter.</p>
               <p>Beer and Ale are common and familiar Drinks in <hi>England,</hi> and no doubt it is profitable and whole≈øome, as Experience ≈øhews: But the different Preparations, or Brewing thereof, make no ≈ømall Difference in the Drink. The Difference of Waters al≈øo, whereof it is made, is greatly to be con≈øidered; therefore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Natures, you mu≈øt judge of the Drink; al≈øo the Difference of the Corn or Grain is to be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; as Drinks made of Wheat-malt nouri≈øh mo≈øt. Some People mix Wheat and Barly together: Others mix ≈øome Oats with Barly for Malt: Generally in Ale are u≈øed no Hops, or le≈øs Hops than in Beer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ale is more nouri≈øhing, and loo≈øens the Belly.</p>
               <p>Cider is a cold Liquor, it is very plea≈øant indeed, but is windy; it is ≈øaid to be good for the Scurvy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe Meat and Drink are of ≈øo great Importance with re≈øpect to the Pre≈øervation of Health, and Cure of Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes, as well as for Su≈øtenance, I ≈øhall here particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tho briefly, di≈øcour≈øe of the various Sorts of Meats, Fruits, and Herbs, which are generally u≈øed for Diet.</p>
               <p>Beans Clean≈øe and fatten, but are windy, therefore occa≈øion Cholick Pains, and di≈øturb the Head. The French is the be≈øt and lea≈øt windy.</p>
               <p>Pea≈øe are not ≈øo windy as Beans, Green Pea≈øe are very plea≈øant to the Ta≈øt, provoke Appetite, are good for Coughs and an A≈øthma; but they are injurious to many, by rea≈øon of their Windine≈øs.</p>
               <p>Rice binds the Body, cures Fluxes, Pains in the Stomach, and Griping in the Guts, but being u≈øed too long, cau≈øes Ob≈øtructions and Wind.</p>
               <p>A≈øparagus is quickly boyled, nouri≈øhes more than all other Herbs, is good for the Stomach, purges the Brea≈øt, provokes Urine, and clean≈øes the Kidneys from Gravel.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:63575:45"/>
               <p>Capers excite Appetite, remove Ob≈øtructions of the Liver and Spleen, kill Worms, and are good for phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic and melancholy People.</p>
               <p>Artichokes are plea≈øant to the Ta≈øte, provoke Urine, and make it ≈øtink, as A≈øparagus does; but they are windy, and injure the Head and Stomach.</p>
               <p>Cabbage loo≈øens the Belly, is good for Stoppage of Urine and other Ob≈øtructions: but it is windy, and cau≈øes a ≈øtinking Breath, and increa≈øes Melancholy.</p>
               <p>Sampier beink pickled, pre≈øerves the Stomach, and is good for the Reins.</p>
               <p>Lettice is ea≈øily dige≈øted, breeds Milk, and provokes Sleep.</p>
               <p>Par≈øly provokes Urine, the Cour≈øes, clean≈øes the Reins, and removes Ob≈øtructions and Wind, but is bad for the Head and Eye-≈øight.</p>
               <p>Garlick is good again≈øt Poi≈øon, the Worms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Urine, and is good for a Drop≈øie and Shortne≈øs of Breath; but is injurious to the Head and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight.</p>
               <p>Carrots breed Milk, provoke the Cour≈øes and Urine, and open Ob≈øtructions; but they are windy.</p>
               <p>Onions increa≈øe Appetite, attenuate the Humours, make a good Colour, and increa≈øe Seed; but they are bad for the Head and Eyes.</p>
               <p>Par≈ønips provoke the Cour≈øes and Urine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Ob≈øtructions; but they are windy, provoke Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, occa≈øion the Itch, and breed bad Blood.</p>
               <p>Leeks provoke Urine and the Cour≈øes, and expel Wind, they are good for the Lungs and Stomach, but they offend the Head.</p>
               <p>Radi≈øhes provoke Urine, expel Gravel, and increa≈øe Milk; but they cau≈øe ≈øtinking Bel≈øhes and Wind.</p>
               <p>Quinces help Dige≈øtion, ≈øtop Fluxes and vomiting, and ≈øtrengthen the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Apples comfort the Heart, open the Brea≈øt, and are pectoral.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:63575:45"/>
               <p>Pears provoke Appetite, and ≈øtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and loo≈øen the Belly: But Bergamots are the mo≈øt whole≈øome, but being eaten before Meals they breed Wind and occa≈øion the Cholick.</p>
               <p>Oranges that are ≈øweet, eaten before Meals, are good for the Stomach. Sowre Oranges quench the Thir≈øt, and excite Appetite; but ≈øowre, or Sevil Oranges bind the Body, cool the Stomach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Brea≈øt, and the ≈øweet increa≈øe Choler.</p>
               <p>Lemons excite Appetite, ≈øtop vomiting, cut gro≈øs Humours, are good in malignant Fevers, and kill Worms. An Ounce of the Juice drank in Wine expells Gravel: But they cool the Stomach, occa≈øion the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and cau≈øe Leanne≈øs, and breed melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>Filberts eaten at the Beginning of Dinner are good again≈øt Gravel; but they are hardly dige≈øted, cau≈øe Wind, and Pains in the Head.</p>
               <p>Walnuts fa≈øten loo≈øe Teeth, they pre≈øerve again≈øt Poi≈øon and the Plague; but they mu≈øt be eaten at Break-fa≈øt, and are good after Fi≈øh; they kill Worms, and being pre≈øerved, they loo≈øen the Belly, and are pectoral: But they hurt the Throat, cau≈øe Coughs, when they are dry, and cau≈øe the Head-ach. The Shade of a Nut-Tree is very injurious; for it ≈øends out ill Vapours that offend the Head.</p>
               <p>Apricocks quench Thir≈øt, excite Appetite, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine; the Kernels kill Worms, and are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for the Heart-burning; but they cau≈øe Fluxes of the Belly, and putrifie quickly, and breed gro≈øs and vi≈øcous Flegm.</p>
               <p>Peaches are good for the Stomach, and loo≈øen the Belly. The be≈øt are tho≈øe that are odoriferous, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, and fully ripe, ≈øo that they come clear from the Stone; they mu≈øt be eaten before Dinner, and good Wine mu≈øt be drank after them; but they ≈øoon corrupt, occa≈øion Wind and ill Humours.</p>

               <p>Olives clean≈øe the Stomach from Flegm, and excite Appetite, and ≈øtop vomiting, the Pickle is good to wa≈øh the Mouth; for it fa≈øtens loo≈øe Teeth, and ≈øtrengthens the Gums.</p>
               <p>Plums purge Choler, extingui≈øh Heat, take away Thir≈øt in ≈øeveri≈øh People, but they injure a cold and weak Stomach, are bad for flegmatick Per≈øons, and ≈øuch as are troubled with the Cholick.</p>
               <p>Cucumbers are very cooling and refre≈øhing in the Summer, they provoke Urine, and are good for the Reins and Bladder, and a hot Stomach; but they are apt to corrupt, and to breed ill Humours, if they are not quickly concocted by the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Strawberries extingui≈øh Heat, take away Thir≈øt, provoke Urine and the Appetite: But they ≈øoon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in the Stomach, and are very injurious to para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytic People, to ≈øuch as are troubled with Convul≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tho≈øe that eat many of them are often ≈øeized with malignant Fevers.</p>
               <p>Melons are very refre≈øhing, they clean≈øe the Body, provoke Urine, quench Thir≈øt, and excite Appetite, and are excellent for the Gravel and Stone: But they occa≈øion Wind and Gripes, and being corrupted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers.</p>
               <p>Fle≈øh is more nouri≈øhing than all other Food, for it is ea≈øily turned into Blood, and affords great Nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You mu≈øt always take notice, that Fle≈øh, Herbs, Fruits and Corn are to be cho≈øen in high Places, ≈øuch as are refre≈øhed with whole≈øome Winds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with the warm Beams of the Sun, where there are no Ponds, Lakes, and ≈øtanding Waters; for in ≈øuch Places they are quickly corrupted. The Fle≈øh of all tho≈øe Creatures which live in Fens and ≈øtanding Pools are to be avoided, as Ducks and Gee≈øe. The Fle≈øh of Creatures too old are naught, hard, dry, ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy, and of ≈ømall Nouri≈øhment, and hard to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted; and on the contrary, ≈øuch as are too young
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63575:46"/>overabound with Moi≈øture, and are full of Superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, tho' ea≈øily concocted in the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Salted Fle≈øh occa≈øions gro≈øs and melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and bad Juice; for it dries much, and nouri≈øhes little. Fat Meat is ea≈øily dige≈øted, but breeds many Superfluities, and therefore is of ≈ømall Nouri≈øhment; it takes away the Appetite, and hinders Dige≈øtion. The leaner nouri≈øhes better, and generates fewer Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities; and therefore the midling betwixt both is mo≈øt whole≈øome.</p>
               <p>The Fle≈øh of Birds is lighter, dryer, and ea≈øier di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted than that of four-footed Bea≈øts, and therefore more agreeable to tho≈øe that exerci≈øe the Mind more than the Body, for they are dige≈øted more ea≈øily, and breed Blood that is clear, clean, and full of Spirits, and fit for the Exerci≈øe of the Mind.</p>
               <p>The Fle≈øh of wild Creatures, and ≈øuch as frequent the Woods is better than that of tame, and the Blood which is bred by eating them, will have fewer Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, by rea≈øon of much running and Exerci≈øe, which they are accu≈øtomed to; and becau≈øe they live in a more dry Air, e≈øpecially ≈øuch as frequent the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and their Fle≈øh will keep longer uncorrupted; for they have le≈øs Fat; and therefore generate fewer Superfluities, nouri≈øh better, and breed a more ≈øound Blood; but tame Creatures are more moi≈øt than wild, by rea≈øon of their little Motion, and the Moi≈øtne≈øs of the Air they live in.</p>
               <p>In moi≈øt Times and Complexions, the Fle≈øh that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Dryne≈øs is mo≈øt proper; and ≈øo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

               <p>Veal nouri≈øhes much, and generates good Blood, and is ea≈øily dige≈øted.</p>

               <p>Brawn made of the Fle≈øh of tame young Bores is a delicate Meat, having not ≈øo much excrementitious Moi≈øture, as Bacon or Pork, but the hard or horny Part is difficultly concocted.</p>

               <p>Capon nouri≈øhes better than all other Fowl, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates good Blood.</p>
               <p>Pidgeons afford good Nouri≈øhment, breed excellent Blood, and are good for old and flegmatic Men. They ≈øtrengthen the Legs, and cure the Pal≈øy; but they are not good for hot Con≈øtitutions.</p>
               <p>Phea≈øants are very agreeable to humane Nature, comfort and ≈øtrengthen the Stomach, yield great Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment, and fatten exceedingly.</p>
               <p>Hens nouri≈øh the Body wonderfully, are ea≈øily dige≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and breed good Blood: But old Hens are of hard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øtion. The Fle≈øh of a Cock is dryer, hot, and ≈øulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:63575:48"/>
               <p>Turky is a good Nouri≈øhment, the Fle≈øh is white≈øt and be≈øt, and excells all others in VVhole≈øomne≈øs; for it is ea≈øily dige≈øted, and breeds good Blood.</p>
               <p>I arks, if they are fat, nouri≈øh well, and are ea≈øily dige≈øted, they are be≈øt in Autumn, and in VVinter.</p>

               <p>Gee≈øe; the be≈øt Parts of them are the VVings and Liver; the Fle≈øh of young Gee≈øe affordeth good Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment, and fattens tho≈øe that are lean. If you feed Gee≈øe with Milk, their Liver is much more plea≈øant, and dige≈øts and nouri≈øhes well enough; but their Fle≈øh is of hard Dige≈øtion.</p>
               <p>Plovers are an excellent and whole≈øome Food, and afford good Nouri≈øhment; only they are of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Juice.</p>
               <p>Eggs of a fat Hen fed with Corn, and trod by the Cock, and fre≈øh laid, are the be≈øt; next to the≈øe is a Phea≈øants Egg; but tho≈øe of a Goo≈øe or Duck are naught, becau≈øe they have a ≈øtrong Smell, and are of hard Dige≈øtion; and therefore a young Hens Egg is beyond all. Let it be ≈ømall, long, and fre≈øh. Eggs are of a copious Nouri≈øhment, they are good for old Men, excite Venery, and open the Brea≈øt. Potched are be≈øt.</p>
               <p>Young Sparrows afford good Nouri≈øhment, excite Venery. Mountain Sparrows have a wonderful Vertue again≈øt the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder; but are of difficult Dige≈øtion, and cau≈øe Melancholy.</p>

               <p>Turtles nouri≈øh excellently, and are ea≈øily dige≈øted; they ≈øtrengthen the Stomach, and quicken the VVit; roa≈øted with Cloves and Juice of Oranges are very good in the Bloody Flux, and for all other Fluxes.</p>
               <p>Fi≈øh, in re≈øpect of Fle≈øh, are of le≈øs Nouri≈øhment, are gro≈øs, flegmatic, cold, and full of Superfluities. The old nouri≈øh more than the young, and tho≈øe that live among≈øt Stones and Rocks are the be≈øt. Fi≈øh are of hard Dige≈øtion, and the ≈øign of their Indige≈øtion is Thir≈øt; ≈øeeing they all cau≈øe Thir≈øt if they remain long in the Stomach; nay, ≈øometimes they corrupt. Concerning Fi≈øh, you may ob≈øerve the≈øe following Rules: 1≈øt. That all Fi≈øh ≈øhould be eaten hot. 2dly. You mu≈øt eat le≈øs of Fi≈øh than of Fle≈øh. 3dly. You mu≈øt not eat them too often. 4thly. You mu≈øt not eat Fi≈øh after great Labour and Exerci≈øe; for then they ea≈øily corrupt; nor mu≈øt they be eaten after other other Food. 5thly. Fi≈øh and Milk are not proper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nor are Eggs to be u≈øed with it. 6thly. Great and ≈ølimy Fi≈øh pickled are better than fre≈øh. 7thly. You mu≈øt ob≈øerve, that the clearer and deeper the VVater is, the better are the Fi≈øh that are nouri≈øhed therein. 8thly. Sea Fi≈øh are whole≈øomer than fre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63575:49"/>Fi≈øh, hotter, and not ≈øo moi≈øt, and their Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment comes near that of Fle≈øh. 9thly. Among≈øt the Sea and River Fi≈øh, tho≈øe are be≈øt which live in rocky Places, next to the≈øe in ≈øandy Places, in ≈øweet, clear, and running VVater, where there is no Filth: But tho≈øe Fi≈øh are naught which live in Pools, Lakes, Mar≈øhes, and in any ≈øtill and muddy Water. 10thly. Among≈øt all the Fi≈øh both in Sea and Rivers, tho≈øe which are not too big are the be≈øt, and which have not a hard and dry Fle≈øh, that ta≈øte and ≈ømell well, are cri≈øp and tender, and have many Fins and Scales. 11thly. Fi≈øh are cold and moi≈øt; and therefore naught for cold Con≈øtitutions, but good for cholerick Men. 12thly. The be≈øt way of dre≈ø≈øing Fi≈øh is to broyl it, to boyl it is the next way, to fry it is the wor≈øt.</p>
               <p>Eels are of a delicate Ta≈øte and good Nouri≈øhment, but offend the Stomach, and are of hard Dige≈øtion, and being u≈øed too often, breed the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Bladder, and occa≈øion the Gout and Convul≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In ≈øhort, whoever eats much of them indangers his Life.</p>
               <p>Carps are the mo≈øt noble of all Fi≈øh, and of a very plea≈øant and grateful Ta≈øte, and nouri≈øh well, in what manner ≈øoever they are eaten.</p>
               <p>Crabs are good for con≈øumptive People, they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh very much, provoke Urine, and clean≈øe the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; but they are of hard Dige≈øtion.</p>
               <p>Lampreys are of excellent Nouri≈øhment, excite Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, and are of a mo≈øt delicious Ta≈øte; but they are of hard Dige≈øtion, bad for gouty People, and for ≈øuch as are troubled with Convul≈øions.</p>
               <p>Pikes nouri≈øh very much; but are of hard Dige≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Oy≈øters provoke Appetite, and they are a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Diet in many Ca≈øes.</p>
               <p>Sturgeon nouri≈øhes well, and excites Venery; but is of hard Dige≈øtion. Of the Spawn or Row of this Fi≈øh Salted
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63575:50"/>is made Cavyare, which provokes Appetite, and makes the Drink reli≈øh.</p>
               <p>Lob≈øters fatten and nouri≈øh much, and their Broth cures Shortne≈øs of Breath; but they are cold and fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, and of a hard Dige≈øtion.</p>
               <p>Sprats being boyled as ≈øoon as they are taken, yield good Nouri≈øhment and ta≈øte plea≈øantly; but they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion VVind.</p>
               <p>Tench are very nouri≈øhing, but of hard Dige≈øtion.</p>
               <p>Salmon is plea≈øant to the Palate, ea≈øily dige≈øted, and affords good Juice.</p>
               <p>Soles, Plaice, and Turbet are highly commended among≈øt Sea Fi≈øh; for they have a delicate Fle≈øh, they yield good Nouri≈øhment, are not ea≈øily corrupted, and are ea≈øily dige≈øted.</p>
               <p>Gudgeons are the be≈øt of all ≈ømall Fi≈øh, whole≈øome Aliment, ea≈øily dige≈øted, and may be ≈øafely given to ≈øick Per≈øons.</p>
               <p>Pearch have ≈øoft, moi≈øt, and tender Fle≈øh, but they nouri≈øh little, and are full of excrementitious Juice.</p>
               <p>Cod-fi≈øh, if fre≈øh, is of good Juice, and ea≈øily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted; but when it is dry, it is of hard Dige≈øtion, and of gro≈øs Nouri≈øhment.</p>
               <p>Barbels: The little ones are better than the great, and ≈øuch as are caught in ≈øtony Places, and not in muddy Ponds; they are very plea≈øant to the Palate; but their Fle≈øh is hard and not ea≈øily dige≈øted.</p>
               <p>Trouts: The bigge≈øt are be≈øt, and ≈øuch as are bred in ≈øweet VVaters. The River Trout nouri≈øhes well, good for young and cholerick, but naught for decrepid and flegmatick Men.</p>
               <p>Vinegar: The be≈øt is that which is made of the be≈øt VVine. It is cutting, dige≈øtive, and openining. It is very good to extingui≈øh the Heat of Choler and Thir≈øt. It ≈øtrengthens the Gums, excites the Appetite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves Ob≈øtructions, helps Dige≈øtion, and is good for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63575:50"/>hot and moi≈øt Stomachs, and re≈øi≈øts Putrefaction; therefore is good in the Plague time: But it breeds melancholy Humours, injures the Nerves, makes lean, offends the Brea≈øt, and being u≈øed too much, makes Men look old and withered.</p>
               <p>Honey is ab≈øter≈øive and opening, provokes Urine, and clean≈øes its Pa≈ø≈øages. It is good for old and fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Men of a cold Con≈øtitution, and is pectoral. <hi>Democritus</hi> being asked how a Man might keep him≈øelf in Health; An≈øwered, by Oyl without, and Honey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It heats the Stomach, moves the Body, re≈øi≈øts Corruption, and turns to good Blood; but it occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons VVind and the Gripes.</p>
               <p>Oyl of Olives is very ≈øweet, and agreeable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. VVhen it is two Years old it is be≈øt, it ought to be made of ripe Olives.</p>
               <p>Oyl of ≈øweet Almonds is next to it in Goodne≈øs. Oyl fattens, and a good Quantity of it is excellent to bring up Poy≈øon by Vomit; but if it be eaten too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it le≈ø≈øens the Appetite.</p>
               <p>Salt, of all Sawces, is be≈øt; without which no Food is good. It is put into Victuals for three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons: 1≈øt.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XI. </hi>Of Sleep and Watching.</head>
               <p>SLeep is the Ce≈ø≈øation of the external Sen≈øes from Operation; the Cau≈øe of Sleep is the Remi≈ø≈øion and Sub≈øidence of the Fibres, wherewith the Brain is chiefly formed, ≈øo that the Motions imprinted upon the Organs of the five external Sen≈øes cannot be duly propagated to the Seat of the Soul, and be known there, as we ≈øee that a Motion upon a ≈ølack String of a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin is not ≈øo readily promoted, as when it is wond up hard. The ≈øaid Remi≈ø≈øion of the Fibres in the Brain ari≈øes from a Defect or Dullne≈øs, ≈øo that the animal Spirits do not ≈øufficiently expand tho≈øe Tubes; and ≈øo after Labour we are inclined to Sleep, by rea≈øon of a Defect of the Spirits. In like manner, after the taking of Opium or other Narcoticks, we are di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to ≈øleep, becau≈øe they ≈øeize the Spirits by their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Oleo≈øity. La≈øtly, we are inclined to ≈øleep after eating or drinking; becau≈øe then the Humidity of the Brain relaxes the Fibres, and perhaps, becau≈øe the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ≈øomewhat hinder the Spirits: But ≈øome, when they drink much, cannot ≈øleep; becau≈øe the Spirits are thereby heated and inraged.</p>
               <p>All Creatures, by long Fatigues and VVatchings, wa≈øte and con≈øume them≈øelves; and therefore ≈øtand in need of Re≈øt and Sleep, the Advantage and Good whereof is, that it reheats and corroborates the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, concocts the Humours, augments the natural Heat, fattens the Body, heals the Infirmities of the Mind, and mitigates and allays Troubles and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows: For whil≈øt we ≈øleep, the Faculties of the Mind repo≈øe them≈øelves. Sleep al≈øo facilitates the Dige≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Food which lies in the Stomach, and not only
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63575:51"/>concocts it there, but al≈øo di≈øtributes it thro' the Parts of the Body; for the natural Heat concenters in the inward Parts, whereby the Food is better concocted. La≈øtly, Sleep removes all La≈ø≈øitude and VVearine≈øs, cau≈øed by overmuch watching; and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Re≈øt from all Labour.</p>
               <p>But we mu≈øt avoid long and ≈øuperfluous Sleep, which is no le≈øs pernicious than the other is good; for it chills the Body, weakens the natural Heat, and breeds flegmatic Humours, whence afterwards proceeds much Sloath and Lazine≈øs, and ≈øends many Vapours to the Head, which are oftentimes the immediate Cau≈øe of Rheums and Catarrhs, and is very de≈øtructive to gro≈øs and fat Bodies. In brief, it is neither good for the Body nor the Mind, nor for Bu≈øine≈øs. He who ≈øleeps too much is but half a Man, Sleep rendring him in all Points like a dead Man except his Dige≈øtion of the Food; for he neither ≈øees, hears, ≈øpeaks, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtands, and is ab≈øolutely deprived of all Rea≈øon; which, for the Time, is a perfect Death. Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sleep moreover, both in ≈øound and firm Bodies generates Shortne≈øs of Breath, and is a con≈øtant Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, and Preparative to an Apoplexy, Lethargy, Pal≈øy, and Numne≈øs, and it hinders the ≈øea≈øonable Evacuation of the Excrements, cau≈øing them to remain longer in the Ve≈ø≈øels and Guts. Sleep ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at ≈øuch a Time as the Stomach is free from all ≈ømoaky Food, the Vapours whereof arriving at the Brain, are congealed and made heavy, and then falling down, they ob≈øtruct the Members.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, too much watching, and want of Sleep generate over much Heat in the Brain, cau≈øe Angui≈øh of Mind, and a bad Dige≈øtion; for by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the natural Heat is weakened, which occa≈øions Crudities.</p>
               <p>Sleep is good for flegmatic Per≈øons; becau≈øe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocts the crude Humours, whence afterwards is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63575:52"/>good Blood, whereby a Man becomes more warm, the natural Heat being increa≈øed by the Plenty of Blood. Sleep moreover is very u≈øeful in choleric Per≈øons, both to quiet the Mind, and to correct the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of the Body: But it is mo≈øt of all requi≈øite in melancholy Men; for by Sleep they acquire a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Stock of Heat and Moi≈øture, things very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Con≈øtitution.</p>
               <p>Sleep, in the Day time, and after Dinner, is not to be allow'd, unle≈øs a Man has accu≈øtomed him≈øelf to it, or has not re≈øted well the Night before, or perceives a kind of La≈ø≈øitude or VVearine≈øs thro' all his Limbs; in the≈øe Ca≈øes he may ≈øleep after Dinner, e≈øpecially if his Stomach be weak and cannot dige≈øt the Food: But po≈øt-meridian Sleep ought to be taken in a Chair, and not to be above an Hour long.</p>
               <p>In long Days Sleep may be taken in a Chair, if the Strength be decayed. Some indeed forbid ≈øleeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, e≈øpecially after Dinner: But I think it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious; for ≈øo the Spirits, weakened by Labour and Cares, are refre≈øhed; and I cannot indeed ≈øee why it is wor≈øe than nocturnal Sleep, only it hinders Sleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights, and makes the Nights ≈øeem long and tedious. The ordinary Time for Sleep is ≈øeven Hours; for that Time ≈øeems ≈øufficient for perfecting Dige≈øtion, and refre≈øhing the Spirits: But ≈øome require more Sleep, ≈øome le≈øs; ≈øo Children require more, and old People, choleric, and dry; becau≈øe it moi≈øtens and re≈øtores the Spirits: But fat and flegmatic People ≈øhould not ≈øleep much. Such as labour much ought to ≈øleep long. It ≈øignifies little on what ≈øide you lye at fir≈øt going to ≈øleep. It is injurious to ≈øleep with an empty Stomach. Sleeping on the Back hurts the Reins, and hinders Breathing, and furthers Di≈øea≈øes of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Signs of ≈øufficient Sleep are a Lightne≈øs and Agility, which ≈øpreads its ≈øelf over all the Body, and chiefly the Brain, whereas Heavine≈øs of the Body, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63575:52"/>un≈øavoury Belchings, ≈øignifie that more Sleep is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. To conclude, moderate Sleep re≈øtores the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Faculties, helps concoction of the Victuals, and crude Humours, cau≈øes a Forgetfulne≈øs of Labour, and of all ≈øorrowful Thoughts, mitigates the Grief of the Mind, moi≈øtens all the Members of the Body, re≈øtores all the wa≈øted Faculties, augments the natural Heat, increa≈øes radical Moi≈øture, clari≈øies and ≈øtrengthens the Sight, takes away Wearine≈øs, refre≈øhing the tired Body, and ≈øtops Fluxes and Rheums: But if immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, it makes the Head heavy, troubles the Mind, weakens the Memory, and all the animal Faculties, makes the Body cold, multiplies Flegm, extingui≈øhes the natural Heat, induces a nau≈øeating, makes the Face pale, and is hurtful to all ≈ølegmatic Di≈øea≈øes.</p>
               <p>Waking is an Inten≈øion, or rather an Exten≈øion of the Soul and Faculties thereof, to all the Parts of the Body; which, when it is moderate, ≈øtirs up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites all the Sen≈øes, di≈øpo≈øes and orders the vital Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their Operations, expelling and driving forth all the ≈øuperfluous Humours from the Body; but if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and exce≈ø≈øive, it generates Di≈øea≈øes of the Head, corrupts the Temperature of the Brain, cau≈øes Madne≈øs, kindles the Humours, excites ≈øharp and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Infirmities, makes Men look pale and lean, and weakens the concoctive Faculty, di≈ø≈øolves the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, fills the Head with Vapours, makes the Eyes hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, increa≈øes Heat, cau≈øes Crudities in the Stomach; therefore let Sleep and Waking be always moderate, and if a Man cannot ≈øleep, let him take at lea≈øt ≈øome Repo≈øe with his Eyes ≈øhut, which in ≈øome ≈øort may ≈øupply the place of Sleep.</p>

               <p>MOtion is here Labour and Exerci≈øe, as walking, playing at Ball, running, riding; they excite natural Heat, and con≈øume all the Crudities of the Body.</p>
               <p>Some Exerci≈øes are ≈øtrong and weari≈øome, and others moderate and gentle; the temperate Exerci≈øe is that which contributes much to the Health; for it corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borates the natural Health, wa≈øtes the Superfluities, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens Youth, chears old Age, and hinders Fullne≈øs, fortifies the Sen≈øes, renders the Body light and agile, ≈øtrengthens the Nerves and all the Joints; for by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe all the Parts become more robu≈øt; it con≈øoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates the Members, helps Dige≈øtion, keeps the Pa≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Body clear and open, ≈øo that the ≈ømoaky Vapours of the Spirits may find a better and more free I≈ø≈øue.</p>
               <p>The gentle Exerci≈øes are fi≈øhing, fowling, and ≈øuch like Diverti≈øements, which clear the Mind: And, as moderate and temperate Exerci≈øe does wonderfully contribute to Health, ≈øo overmuch Idlene≈øs is very pernicious.</p>
               <p>Frictions are al≈øo exceeding u≈øeful; for they hinder the Humours from falling into the Joints, and being u≈øed in the right Time, that is, when the Superfluities ≈øhall be evaporated from the inward Parts, they help Dige≈øtion, recreate the Body, and open the Pores, whereby the moi≈øt Humours, and Vapours of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obtain an ea≈øier Pa≈ø≈øage; al≈øo draw the Blood to the outward Parts, and confirm the natural Heat.</p>
               <p>Exerci≈øe is to be u≈øed ≈øo long as the Body can bear it, without growing too weary, that is, till you wax hot,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63575:54"/>having a fre≈øh Colour, and begin to ≈øweat, which, as ≈øoon as you perceive, change your Cloaths, and dry well all the Members, and put on other Cloaths, and if it be nece≈ø≈øary, lye a little in Bed and re≈øt your ≈øelf, till you ≈øhall be refre≈øhed, and recover new Strength.</p>
               <p>Shooting with a Bow is counted a proper Exerci≈øe for the Brea≈øt and Lungs; bowling for the Back and Reins: But riding on Horeback is the be≈øt Exerci≈øe of all, and may ≈øerve in≈øtead of all.</p>
               <p>The Time for Exerci≈øe is before Meals, having fir≈øt evacuated the Excrements of the Belly and Bladder; for it is u≈øually very bad and de≈øtructive to exerci≈øe the Body pre≈øently after Meals, and this is the Source of divers Infirmities; but Labourers and Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by continual Cu≈øtom, labour without Injury, as ≈øoon as the Meat is out of their Mouths.</p>
               <p>After violent Exerci≈øe, one ought to beware of catching cold; for the Motion and Exerci≈øe having opened the Pores of the Body, the cold ea≈øily enters therein, bringing along with it Catarrhs, and diver≈øe other Infirmities.</p>
               <p>Friction or rubbing is to be u≈øed in the Morning, after having been at Stool, which mu≈øt be performed on the extream Parts of the Body; begin at the Knees, and proceed to the Feet, then the Thighs, then from upper Ribs to the lower, then from the Shoulders down the Back, and la≈øtly, from the Arms to the Hands. You mu≈øt u≈øe a Napkin or Towel, gently rubbing your Body, till the Skin wax ≈øomething red. In old Men the Motion of the ≈øuperiour Members, as the Arms and the Shoulders, is mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe it diverts and prohibits the Humours from falling into the lower Parts.</p>
               <p>It is proper for every Per≈øon to pull off his Shoes and Stockings him≈øelf, without the Help of a Servant; for this is ≈øome ≈øort of Exerci≈øe, and ≈øtirs up the Heat and Spirits. By the by, the binding the Stockings
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63575:55"/>hard with Garters cau≈øes ≈øeveral Pains, and hinders the Heat, Blood, and Spirits from circulating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcending into the Joints, upon which account they are weakened, and apt to receive divers Di≈øtempers.</p>
               <p>In the Morning, as ≈øoon as you are up, rub well your Head, and comb it with an Ivory Comb, from the Forehead upwards to the Crown, then with a rough Cloath or Sponge rub your Head,; for hereby the Superfluities which are lodg'd there will be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Spirits rarified, and the Pa≈ø≈øages of the Head opened, and the Memory and other Faculties of the Mind corroborated, and the Sight ≈øtrengthened. It is al≈øo good to ≈øhave the Beard often, becau≈øe it chears the Man; ≈øo does the wa≈øhing of the Face and Hands; the Eyes are al≈øo to be wa≈øhed with fre≈øh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the putting the Eyes into cool fre≈øh Water, open, wonderfully clears and purifies the Sight; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dry them very well with a clean Towel. Take care al≈øo that your Teeth be very clean, which for want of well rubbing and clean≈øing, cau≈øes a naughty and ≈øtinking Breath, and the Filth of the Teeth mixed with the Food, breeds Corruption, and renders it putrified: Be≈øides, rotten Teeth ≈øend to the Brain an infectious Vapour. It is good ≈øometimes to wa≈øh the Mouth with Wine.</p>
               <p>No Exerci≈øe is proper after Dinner, but a quiet Compo≈øure and Stillne≈øs of the Body is mo≈øt requi≈øite, e≈øpecially for an Hour after Dinner, after which a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle walking is not ami≈øs to dige≈øt and jog down the Victuals to the Bottom of the Stomach. La≈øtly, Tho≈øe Exerci≈øes are be≈øt which are performed in the open Air, rather than in Hou≈øes, in the Sun rather than in the Shade.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe that by ≈øome Accident or other cannot walk, let them ride, or be carried in a Hor≈øe-litter, ≈øo that they may in ≈øome manner exerci≈øe them≈øelves before Meals; for by Idlene≈øs, and over much Re≈øt, all the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63575:55"/>Faculties of Body and Mind are enervated, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, Ob≈øtructions, and infinite Numbers of Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes are occa≈øioned; and Idlene≈øs is reckoned the chief Cau≈øe of cold Di≈øea≈øes, it makes Men negligent, ≈øloathful, ignorant, and makes the Body fat, lazy, weak, and cau≈øes a pale Complexion, extingui≈øhes the natural Heat, increa≈øes Flegm, and fills the Body with Superfluities; it occa≈øions the Gout, Catarrhs, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions, and the falling Sickne≈øs; therefore when at any time you are nece≈ø≈øitated to be in Idlene≈øs, or by ≈øome Bu≈øine≈øs or Incumbrance are forced to ab≈øtain from all manner of Exerci≈øe, you mu≈øt, in≈øtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ob≈øerve a ≈ølender Diet, and u≈øe that Food which is of mo≈øt ea≈øie Dige≈øtion, and Broaths, which, without any Trouble or Difficulty, are dige≈øted and di≈øtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thro' all the Body, and cau≈øe a Slipperyne≈øs of the Belly.</p>
               <p>Superfluous Re≈øt being therefore ≈øo very injurious, and Sloath and Lazine≈øs the Cau≈øe of ≈øo many grievous Di≈øea≈øes, as we ≈øee tho≈øe in Pri≈øons always fall into Di≈øea≈øes, it behoves us to u≈øe moderate Exerci≈øe, whereby Superfluities may be removed, the Cau≈øes of ≈øo many Di≈øea≈øes. Moreover, we ought not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Exerci≈øe of the Mind, for as the Body with Exerci≈øe is rendred ≈øtrong and robu≈øt, ≈øo the Mind is nouri≈øhed by Studies, and acquires fre≈øh Vigour; and many, by a continual Exerci≈øe of the Mind, have freed their Bodies from great Di≈øea≈øes. The Exerci≈øes of the Mind are Speculation, ≈øinging with mu≈øical In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Study of Hi≈øtory, Divinity, and the like; for the≈øe things delighting the Mind, feed it in ≈øuch ≈øort that all the Virtues become more ≈øtrong, and better enabled to re≈øi≈øt and overcome Infirmities; and the≈øe Exerci≈øes performed at due Times, that is, after a perfect Concoction of your Victuals, both nouri≈øh and corroborate the Mind, and render the Memory quick and la≈øting. But if the≈øe Exerci≈øes of the Mind are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63575:56"/>u≈øed out of ≈øea≈øon, they hinder Dige≈øtion, and heap up and contract many Superfluities, and occa≈øion vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ob≈øtructions, and putrid Fevers.</p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms, that moderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe is above all things mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary for flegmatick People, and for ≈øuch as are of a cold and moi≈øt Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and that for hot and cholerick Per≈øons, Re≈øt is very fit and commodious. Moreover, all learned Phy≈øicians agree, that both Exerci≈øe and Re≈øt, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, are a ≈øpecial means to pre≈øerve Health, and prolong Life.</p>

The≈øe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, in their natural E≈øtate, are ≈øomewhat ≈øoft, and ≈øtick together, the Colour is browni≈øh, and they do not ≈øtink very much.</p>
               <p>The Urine, when it is right, is of a yellow Colour, of a moderate Thickne≈øs, with or without a Sediment. When there is a Sediment it is white, light, and equal, and the Quantity is equal to the Liquors taken in. When it is retained too long, either by the Fault of the Reins, or of the Bladder, or becau≈øe the Matter of it is not ≈øufficiently ≈øeparated, it occa≈øions a Drop≈øy, Fainting, ≈øleepy Di≈øea≈øes, a Pal≈øy, and the like.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV. </hi>Of the Pa≈ø≈øions of the Mind.</head>
               <p>THE chief Pa≈ø≈øions of the Mind are Mirth, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Anger, Love, Hatred, Shame, Hope, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpair.</p>
               <p>Mirth is a Delight ari≈øing from ≈øome Good, we ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe we have obtained. This above all the re≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to Health, at lea≈øt if it be moderate; for in it the Spirits pa≈øs plea≈øantly in the Brain, and in all the Nerves: But immoderate Mirth is injurious, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deadly.</p>
               <p>Sorrow is a Pain ari≈øing from the Apprehen≈øion of Ill befalling us. In it the Spirits in the Brain and Nerves move very weakly, and ≈øometimes a Weight in the Brea≈øt, Suffocation, and Death it ≈øelf are occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by it.</p>
               <p>Anger is the De≈øire of Revenge, upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion of ≈øome Injury offered us. In Anger the Spirits are wont to be violently moved in the Brain.</p>
               <p>Love is the De≈øire of an Object which we apprehend to be good and convenient. In Love both the Blood
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63575:57"/>and Spirits, within and without the Brain are moved plea≈øantly.</p>
               <p>Hatred is the Apprehen≈øion of an Object, which we judge hurtful or inconvenient. Hatred is Sorrow for the Good, and Mirth for the Ill of another.</p>
               <p>Fear is a ≈øinking of the Mind by rea≈øon of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion of ≈øome imminent Ill.</p>
               <p>Shame is a great Opinion, or Apprehen≈øion of Scandal.</p>
               <p>Hope is a De≈øire of ≈øome future Good that ≈øeems difficult to be obtained; but yet po≈ø≈øible.</p>
               <p>De≈øpair is an Affection of the Mind ari≈øing from the Apprehen≈øion of Good, which we judge impo≈ø≈øible to be obtained.</p>
               <p>The Pa≈ø≈øions of the Mind have great Power, and do much contribute to the changing of the Body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they make a Stirring and Motion in the Humours, and in the Spirits. And the≈øe immoderate and ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Motions are rai≈øed from the Center of the Body to the Circumference, as Anger, Joy, and the like, or from the Circumference to the Center, as Fear, and the like, from whence proceed great Motions of the Spirits; and therefore we ought carefully to avoid ≈øuch Pa≈ø≈øions, ≈øeeing they dry the Body, and alter it too much, troubling it and changing it from its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Con≈øtitution; and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> called the≈øe the Infirmities of the Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Anger, Joy, Sorrow, Melancholy, Anxiety, or Angui≈øh, Exclamation, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Violence, Brawling, Contention, Hatred, Envy, Perplexity, Fear, Shame, unplea≈øant Thoughts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled De≈øires, Boldne≈øs, Incontinence, Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Ambition, Di≈øtru≈øt, Hope, De≈øpair, and the like; all which Pa≈ø≈øions, be≈øides the great Hurt they do to the Body, do al≈øo very much offend the Mind; for Anger and overmuch Sorrow afflict the Spirits, dry the Bones, extenuate the Fle≈øh, inflame and burn the Body, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into Confu≈øion, out of its natural E≈øtate,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63575:58"/>whence afterwards proceed many Evils, as Catarrhs and Fluxes in the Joints, and the like: But the≈øe Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, when they are moderate, are ≈øometimes good for Men, and do not a little contribute to their Health: For Example, Anger excites and increa≈øes the natural Heat, and oftentimes it is good to be angry, to repair that natural Heat, and therefore, in cold Di≈øea≈øes, it is to be ≈øtirred up: as on the contrary, in hot, it is to be avoided. Joy and Gladne≈øs ≈øtrengthens the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øtion, and this is the chief and true≈øt rea≈øon why Men, more than all other Creatures, are expo≈øed to Crudities: Becau≈øe the Bea≈øts, and irrational Animals, tho' they eat to Satiety, neverthele≈øs do not hinder the natural Virtue which concocts the Food. But Men, by diver≈øe Thoughts, and Perturbations of Mind, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Virtue of its Operation, and tho' they eat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, yet they fall into Crudities, whence proceed many Di≈øea≈øes; and therefore a Man, by all po≈ø≈øible means, ought to avoid ≈øad Thoughts, and dolorous Subjects, and all other things which may any ways di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturb the Mind; for to have a chearful Mind is good in all Di≈øea≈øes. You mu≈øt keep your ≈øelf al≈øo from frequent weeping, from great Fury, and from an Appetite or De≈øire of Revenge; for the≈øe things weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Brain, and hinder the Dige≈øtion, and alter the natural State of the Body; for Fear withdraws the Spirits and the Blood, attracting them inwardly to the Heart, whence the Members grow cold, the Body pale, cau≈øing Tremblings, the Voice is interrupted, and the whole Force of the Body is deficient. Many have peri≈øhed by overmuch Fear and Sorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rutilius</hi> being denyed the Con≈øul≈øhip, which he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly ≈øought after, ≈øuddenly expired. <hi>Marcus Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> al≈øo died for Grief, and many have died by Exce≈øs of Joy; but none of Anger, and ≈øome have died of Shame. For which Cau≈øe the≈øe Pa≈ø≈øions of the Mind ought always to be u≈øed with Moderation, and chiefly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63575:58"/>Joy. In ≈øhort, nothing is more nece≈ø≈øary for the Pre≈øervation of Health, than to live merrily, nor to trouble ones ≈øelf, or be angry. That Man therefore that loves Health, let him delight in Gardens, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent green and plea≈øant Places, let him conver≈øe with merry and jocund Friends, with Mu≈øick and Songs; for by the≈øe things the Spirits are re≈øtored, and as the Strength of a Man is increa≈øed by good Victuals, Wine, ≈øweet Smells, ≈øo by Tranquility, by avoiding of Cares and trouble≈øome Affairs, which render a Man ≈øad, and by frequenting merry Companions the Man is refre≈øhed. Likewi≈øe it is good to hear and read plea≈øant Di≈øcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes and delightful Subjects. No le≈øs plea≈øant and whole≈øome it is to enjoy a ≈øweet and clear Air, to walk ≈øometimes in the Fields, to ri≈øe betimes in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than which there is nothing in the World that chears and glads the Heart of Man more, and does al≈øo wonderfully contribute to Health. To conclude, in Trouble and Adver≈øity, let a Man defend him≈øelf from Dejection of Mind, and in Pro≈øperity from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Joy.</p>

               <p>THings contrary to Nature, or preternatural, are things oppo≈øite to the natural Con≈øtitution of a living Body. They are three, a Di≈øea≈øe, the Cau≈øe of a Di≈øea≈øe, and the Symptom; under which every thing contrary to Nature is comprehended.</p>
               <p>A Di≈øea≈øe is a Con≈øtitution contrary to the nature of a living Body, whereby all the actions are not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed. This Con≈øtitution proceeds from an undue temper, conformation or union of the Parts,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63575:59"/>whereby ≈øome action is performed ill, or at lea≈øt not rightly modified, and hereby we are rendred incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform all the actions aright. It is ≈øaid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the Actions are not perform'd aright; becau≈øe an ob≈øtruction of all the actions is not required to a Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe; but it is ≈øaid to be a Di≈øea≈øe, if any one of them be hurt.</p>
               <p>When we ≈øay a Di≈øea≈øe is a Con≈øtitution contrary to Nature, it does not include the Con≈øtitution of old Men and Children, tho in it the actions are not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed; becau≈øe ≈øuch Ages are agreeable to the cour≈øe of Nature.</p>
               <p>The living Body, and the ≈øolid and fluid parts of it are the ≈øubjects of a Di≈øea≈øe.</p>
               <p>A Di≈øea≈øe is divided e≈ø≈øentially into three ≈øpecies; into a Di≈øea≈øe from an undue temper, or ≈øimilar; into a Di≈øea≈øe from an ill formation, or organick; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Di≈øea≈øe occa≈øioned from the ≈øolution of the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum.</hi> It is al≈øo otherwi≈øe variou≈øly divided according to its accidental differences, into univer≈øal, particular, contagious, not contagious, epidemic, endemic, long, ≈øhort, acute, not acute, benign, malignant, great, ≈ømall, ≈øimple, compound, primary, ≈øecundary, ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatic, hereditary.</p>
               <p>A Similar Di≈øea≈øe, or a Di≈øea≈øe proceeding from an undue temper, ari≈øes from an inconvenient temper of the fir≈øt qualities, as a Di≈øea≈øe from a hot or cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies of the Brain or Stomach, or the like.</p>
               <p>An Organick Di≈øea≈øe is a Di≈øea≈øe ari≈øing from an ill Formation of the Part. It is fourfold, ari≈øing from an undue Figure, magnitude, number, and Situation of the Part.</p>
               <p>A Di≈øea≈øe proceeding from a ≈øolution of the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum</hi> is a hurt of the Function of a Similar, or Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Part. It is fourfold, <hi>viz.</hi> a Contu≈øion, a Wound, a Fracture, and an Ulcer.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:63575:59"/>
               <p>An univer≈øal Di≈øea≈øe is that which affects the whole Body, as Cachexy, Ana≈øarca, and the like.</p>
               <p>A particular Di≈øea≈øe is that which affects only part of the Body, as a Pleurifie, and the like.</p>
               <p>A contagious Di≈øea≈øe is that which is conveyed to another by ≈øome Effluvia.</p>
               <p>Di≈øea≈øes called <hi>Pandemij,</hi> are Di≈øea≈øes of the ≈øame Species, which invade many at the ≈øame time, and in the ≈øame Region.</p>
               <p>An Epidemic or Popular Di≈øea≈øe, is a Di≈øea≈øe ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing from ≈øome common Cau≈øe, and ≈øeizes many at one time and place, but is not re≈øtrained to one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the Plague, Quin≈øie, Pleuri≈øie.</p>
               <p>An Endemic Di≈øea≈øe is a Di≈øea≈øe ari≈øing from ≈øome common cau≈øe, that is proper to ≈øome Region or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, as the Scurvy to <hi>Holland, Denmark, Swedeland, Norway;</hi> the French Pox to <hi>India,</hi> the Bronchochele to the <hi>Alpes,</hi> the <hi>Plicae Poloniae,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>Sporadic Di≈øea≈øes are Di≈øea≈øes of different kinds, which invade many at the ≈øame time, and in the ≈øame Region, as a Pleuri≈øie, and Ophthalmia.</p>
               <p>From the Time Di≈øea≈øes are ≈øhort or long. A Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe is ≈øhort that ≈øoon comes to its end; as a Diary, a burning Fever, and the like. A Di≈øea≈øe is long, when it does not come to its end in a ≈øhort time, as a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie, Pal≈øie, and the like.</p>
               <p>A Di≈øea≈øe is Acute, when it comes to its end in a ≈øhort time with danger. An extream Acute Di≈øea≈øe ends in three or four days at farthe≈øt; as a Pe≈øtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Fever, or the like. It is ≈øaid to be peracute, when it la≈øts ≈øeven days.</p>
               <p>A benign Di≈øea≈øe is that which has its wonted ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as a Tertian Ague; or a burning Fever, that has its ordinary ≈øymptoms.</p>
               <p>A Di≈øea≈øe is malignant, when the ≈øymptoms are wor≈øe than is u≈øual.</p>

               <p>From Magnitude a Di≈øea≈øe is ≈øaid to be great or ≈ømall. The Magnitude of a Di≈øea≈øe may be two ways con≈øidered. Fir≈øt, with compari≈øon to the Per≈øon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and ≈øo a Di≈øea≈øe ≈ømall in it ≈øelf may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted great, in a weak Man or a Child. Secondly, Di≈øea≈øe is called great which ≈øoon dejects the ≈øtrength, and kills; and the greatne≈øs of it may ari≈øe from the noblene≈øs, or great u≈øe of the part afflicted.</p>
               <p>A ≈øimple Di≈øea≈øe is an Ob≈øtruction of ≈øome Vein or Wound, or a cold Intemperies of the Stomach, or the like. A compound Di≈øea≈øe is ≈øimilar, with organit, ≈øimilar with common: For in≈øtance an hot Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with a Wound. Organic with common; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, the Magnitude of the Foot increa≈øed with a Wound. Similar with organic and common, as a Wound of the Hand with a great and hot ≈øwelling.</p>
               <p>A Primary Di≈øea≈øe is a Di≈øea≈øe produced by ≈øome Cau≈øe, which is not a Di≈øea≈øe in the ≈øame Body.</p>
               <p>A ≈øecundary Di≈øea≈øe is a Di≈øea≈øe produced by ≈øome Cau≈øe in the ≈øame Body, as the cold Intemperies of the Brain occa≈øioned by a cold Intemperies of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>An idiopathic Di≈øea≈øe is a Di≈øea≈øe proceeding from the proper Vice of the Part, as an Ob≈øtruction of the Reins by a Stone.</p>
               <p>An hereditary Di≈øea≈øe is a Di≈øea≈øe imparted to the Child by the Parents, obnoxious to ≈øuch a kind of Di≈øea≈øe, upon account of the Fault of the Seed, or of the Nutriment of the Child. I ≈øay obnoxious, for it is not nece≈ø≈øary the Parents ≈øhould actually have the Di≈øea≈øe, or that they ≈øhould ever have it. Perhaps it is prevented by a contrary Cour≈øe of Diet, or the like, it is enough if there be ≈øuch a Di≈øpo≈øition.</p>
               <p>The Time of the Di≈øea≈øe is the Time wherein ≈øome notable Change of the Di≈øea≈øe is ob≈øerved. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal Time is that which di≈øtingui≈øhes the Cour≈øe of the whole Di≈øea≈øe. It is fourfold, the Beginning, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe, State, and Declination; the≈øe four Times are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63575:60"/>ab≈øolutely accounted in every Di≈øea≈øe, whether it tends to Life or Death, whether it be cured by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or not: But the≈øe Times are went to be very unequal; becau≈øe one Di≈øea≈øe runs its Cour≈øe much ≈øooner than another, and con≈øequently pa≈ø≈øes all the Sea≈øons ≈øooner.</p>
               <p>No one dies in the univer≈øal Declination of a Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, at lea≈øt of that Di≈øea≈øe, whereof that is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; for the Cau≈øe of the Di≈øea≈øe is expelled and overcome, yet he may die in the Declination by ≈øome other Di≈øea≈øe joined with it, or coming upon it, or by Defect, or Want of things requi≈øite to Life.</p>
               <p>The particular Time of the Di≈øea≈øe is that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øhes the Cour≈øe of the Paroxy≈øm. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxy≈øm is the Exacerbation coming by turns in Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes. The Period is the Time of Exacerbation and Remi≈ø≈øion in ≈øome Di≈øea≈øes. The Type is the Order of Inten≈øion and Remi≈ø≈øion: But every Di≈øea≈øe has not a Type or Period, as an Atrophy, Pal≈øy, Eliphantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis, and the like; for they continually afflict.</p>
               <p>A Relap≈øe is the Return of a Di≈øea≈øe cured, after a ≈øhort time.</p>
               <p>The Cau≈øe of a Di≈øea≈øe with Phy≈øicians, is a thing contrary to Nature, effecting a Di≈øea≈øe. It is divided into procatarctic, antecedent, and continent. The procatarctic Cau≈øe is the Cau≈øe that is evident to any one. It is twofold, internal and external. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal are all the Pa≈ø≈øions of the Mind, Anger, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Mirth, Pain, and the like. The external are a Stone, a Sword, a Knife, a Stick, Air, Meat and Drink, and the like.</p>
               <p>The antecedent Cau≈øe is a Cau≈øe not evident to every one, which being taken off, the Di≈øea≈øe does not pre≈øently cea≈øe, ≈øuch is the Abundance of Blood, which cau≈øes an Inflammation in ≈øome Part; being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by bleeding, the Inflammation does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently cea≈øe.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:63575:61"/>
               <p>The containing Cau≈øe is that which being taken of the Di≈øea≈øe pre≈øently cea≈øes.</p>
               <p>A Plethora is too great a Quantity of Blood.</p>
               <p>A Cacochymy is an ill Quality of the Blood.</p>
               <p>A Symptom is an Effect of a Di≈øea≈øe, as Thir≈øt of a Fever: A Symptom ought to follow a Di≈øea≈øe as its Cau≈øe; either nearly or remotely. A Di≈øea≈øe may be al≈øo a Symptom, ≈øo is a Fever following an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A Symptom is divided into three general Species, <hi>viz.</hi> The Action Hurt, the Fault of things evacuated and retained, and the Quality of the Blood changed.</p>
               <p>The Action is hurt when it is not as it ≈øhould be. There are three Kinds of Action hurt, <hi>viz.</hi> aboli≈øhed, dimini≈øhed, and depraved. The Fault of things er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted and retained is fivefold, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Sub≈øtance, of the Quantity, of the Quality, of the manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and of the Time of Excretion.</p>
               <p>The Quality of the Body changed, is a Quality con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature, in the ≈øolid Parts of the Body, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Di≈øea≈øe: It is ≈øen≈øible and in≈øen≈øible.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI. </hi>Of the Signs in general, and of ≈øome of the Species of them.</head>
               <p>ASign, among Phy≈øicians, is a manife≈øt thing that leads us to the Knowledge of ≈øomething that is hidden. It is divided into diagno≈øtic, progno≈øtic, and commemorative; and the≈øe are ≈øubdivided into healthy and unhealthy. I do not add neutral; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I think there is no ≈øuch thing as a neutral Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; becau≈øe every one is either ≈øick or well.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:63575:61"/>
               <p>A diagno≈øtic Sign is moreover in≈øeparable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and al≈øo in≈øeparable and proper together. The diagno≈øtic is that which ≈øignifies ≈øomething pre≈øent. The progno≈øtic is that which ≈øignifies ≈øomething that is future. The commemorative Sign is that which ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ≈øomething that is pa≈øt. The healthy Sign is that which ≈øignifies Health pre≈øent, future, or pa≈øt. An unhealthy Sign is that which ≈øignifies a Di≈øea≈øe pre≈øent, pa≈øt, or to come. An in≈øeparable diagno≈øtic Sign is that which ≈øignifies ≈øome Con≈øtitution, and cannot be ≈øeparated from it. A proper diagno≈øtic Sign is that which agrees only to one. This Sign is truly pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic; for it ≈øignifies the proper Nature and E≈ø≈øence of the Di≈øea≈øe from whence it flows: But it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily not one ≈øimple Sign, but a Heap of many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for in≈øtance, a pricking Pain in the Side, with a Cough, and Difficulty of Breathing, a Fever, and a a ≈øtrong Pul≈øe, of a Pleuri≈øie.</p>
               <p>An healthy diagno≈øtic Sign is a natural Pul≈øe, and a natural Urine. An healthy Progno≈øtic is the Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Excrements in Di≈øea≈øes. An healthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative Progno≈øtic is a Firmne≈øs of all the Actions; for that ≈øignifies pre≈øent Health. An unhealthy Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øtic is an Hurt of the Action, as a Swelling with Redne≈øs, and a beating Pain, of an In≈ølammation. An unhealthy Progno≈øtic is ≈øpontaneous La≈ø≈øitude. An unhealthy commemorative Sign is a <hi>Cicatrix;</hi> al≈øo the Weakne≈øs of tho≈øe that recover.</p>
               <p>Signs are generally taken from the Cau≈øes, as the Fountain, or from the Effects; that is, from all tho≈øe things which any way follow Health, the Di≈øea≈øe, or the Cau≈øes of it. Some will have the E≈ø≈øence of a thing to be added here, and ≈øo they ≈øay that a Piece of the Lungs being ca≈øt up, an Ulcer of them is bred, or Part of the thick Guts being ca≈øt out by Stool in a Di≈øente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they ≈øay they know the gro≈øs Guts are affected: But in the Ca≈øes mentioned, the Sign is not taken
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63575:62"/>from the very E≈ø≈øence of the thing, as di≈øtinct from the Cau≈øes and Effects, but meerly from the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>The progno≈øtic Sign, both healthy and unhealthy, ≈øerves much for the Honour of the Phy≈øician; for a ≈øucce≈øsful Progno≈øtication gives him great Authority, and makes the ≈øick better tru≈øt him: But he mu≈øt be careful that he be not too free or ra≈øh in his Progno≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, le≈øt he get Di≈øgrace.</p>
               <p>A Di≈øea≈øe may be known by four Signs: Fir≈øt, By the Species of what is excreted, ≈øo a Di≈øentery is known by the ≈ømall Parts of the Inte≈øtines evacuated by Stool, a ≈øtony Con≈øtitution by a ≈øandy Urine. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, By the Nature of the Place, ≈øo a Di≈øea≈øe or ill Con≈øtitution from Worms is known by Pains torturing the Belly. Thirdly, from the Propriety of the Pain, ≈øo an Inflammation is known by a beating Pain. Fourthly, By proper Accidents, ≈øo a burning Fever is known by a violent Heat of the whole Body, and by the Blackne≈øs of the Tongue, and a great Thir≈øt; a Pleuri≈øie by difficult breathing, with a Cough and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. There are al≈øo be≈øides three more Signs that are le≈øs principal, <hi>viz.</hi> a Proclivity of the ≈øick to a certain Di≈øea≈øe; ≈øo an hy≈øteric Pa≈ø≈øion is known in ≈øome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by their Di≈øpo≈øition that way. The evident Cau≈øe foregoing the Di≈øea≈øe, ≈øo a hot Di≈øea≈øe is known in tho≈øe that u≈øe a hot Diet, tho≈øe things that do Good or Hurt; ≈øo a hot Di≈øea≈øe is known, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exa≈øperated by hot Medicines, and mitigated by cold.</p>
               <p>The Cau≈øe of the Di≈øea≈øe is known chiefly by ≈øeven Signs: Fir≈øt, By the Temperament, and ≈øo by a hot Temperament we may know the Cau≈øe of the Di≈øea≈øe is hot. Secondly, By the Colour of the Skin, ≈øo by the yellow Colour of the Skin, you may know that Bile is the Cau≈øe. Thirdly, By the Age, ≈øo by Old Age you may know the Cau≈øe is cold; by Youth you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63575:62"/>may know it is hot. Fourthly, By the Species of the Pain; ≈øo Bile is known by a burning Pain. Fifthly, By the evident Cau≈øe, ≈øo by high and plentiful feeding, and a ≈øedentary Life, you may know that too great a Quantity of Blood is the Cau≈øe, ≈øo by a cooling Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doing good, you may know that the Cau≈øe is hot.</p>
               <p>The Signs of a Plethora are, a tumid Habit of the Body, an Expan≈øion and Ten≈øion of the Veins, a red Colour of the whole Body, e≈øpecially of the Face, a full Pul≈øe, an Unfitne≈øs for Motion, a ≈øpontaneous and ten≈øive La≈ø≈øitude in the whole Body, a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life, Suppre≈ø≈øion of u≈øual Evacuations, and the like.</p>
               <p>The Signs of Cacochymy are diver≈øe, as the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of it are diver≈øe, the chief whereof are choleric, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, flegmatic, ≈øanguine, and ≈øerous, and they are in the whole Body, or only in Part of it. The Signs of a bilious Cacochymy, are a yellow Colour of the Skin, e≈øpecially of the Face, an high colour'd Urine, quick Pal≈øe, choleric Excrements, choleric Pu≈øtles, a Pricking in the Habit of the Body, an hot and dry Diet, Relief by cold and moi≈øt things, and the like. The Signs of a flegmatick Cacochymy are, a white Colour of the Skin, a ≈øoft and tumid Habit of the Body, flegmatic Excretions, a pale Urine, much Sleep, Relief by hot and dry things, a cold and moi≈øt Diet.</p>
               <p>The Signs of Wind are, a Ten≈øion and Tumour without Gravity, which does not pit upon pre≈ø≈øing with the Finger, a wandering Pain, an Eruption, or bel≈øhing of Wind, a flatulent Diet, and the like.</p>
               <p>The Part affected is known by five Signs. Fir≈øt, By the Action hurt, ≈øo a Di≈øorder of the Ear is known by Dea≈øne≈øs. Secondly, By the Situation of the Di≈øea≈øe, ≈øo you may know the Spleen is affected by a hard ≈øwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the left Side. Thirdly, by the Propriety of the Pain, ≈øo you may know a Membrane is affected by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63575:63"/>a pungent Pain; you may know a Parenchyma is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a heavy Pain. Fourthly, By proper Accidents, ≈øo by Anxiety you may know the Stomach is affected, and by fainting you may know the Heart is affected. Fifthly, by things that are evacuated, as you may know the Lungs are affected by ≈ømall Particles of the ≈øpongy Fle≈øh ca≈øt up by coughing; you may al≈øo know the Bowels are affected by the Excrements com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a Wound of the Belly, ≈øo that things evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated are not here to be under≈øtood only of tho≈øe things which come from the Sub≈øtance of the Part affected, but al≈øo things contained in it. Moreover, as to things evacuated, three things are further to be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which do mo≈øt di≈øtinctly ≈øhew the affected Part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Propriety of the Sub≈øtance excreted, and ≈øo by Froth ca≈øt up, we may know the Lungs are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2dly. By the Magnitude of the Sub≈øtance excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ≈øo a gro≈ø≈øer Tunic of the Guts being voided by Stool, we may know a gro≈øs Gut is affected. La≈øtly, By the Manner of Evacuation, ≈øo an Artery hurt is known by the impetuous Efflux of the Blood.</p>
               <p>A Symptom that is manife≈øt is known by it ≈øelf, but that which is ob≈øcure is be≈øt known by ≈øome more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt Symptom of the ≈øame Di≈øea≈øe; and remotely and ob≈øcurely by the Di≈øea≈øe, and the Cau≈øe of it, ≈øo by the wa≈øting of the Body, as by the mo≈øt remarkable Symptom, we know that Nutrition is le≈ø≈øened, and ≈øo a Fault of Sanguification by an ill Colour of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a weak Con≈øtriction of the Heart, by a weak Pul≈øe.</p>
               <p>By four Signs e≈øpecially you may know whether the Di≈øea≈øe will be cured, or will kill, <hi>viz.</hi> By the Species of it, the Magnitude of it, with a re≈øpect to the Strength of the ≈øick, by the Motion of it, and the Manner of it, ≈øo for in≈øtance, a Di≈øea≈øe that is known to be deadly by its Species, is a Con≈øumption, a Wound of the Heart, the Plague, a Cancer, and the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63575:63"/>like: A Di≈øea≈øe on the contrary, which is known by its Species to be curable, is an Ephemeral Fever, and the like: A Di≈øea≈øe which is known to be deadly by its Magnitude, is either great in its ≈øelf, or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively ≈øo; becau≈øe it is to la≈øt long, e≈øpecially if it be al≈øo malignant. A Di≈øea≈øe is known to be deadly by the wor≈øt and mo≈øt grievous Symptoms. La≈øtly, a deadly Di≈øea≈øe is known by its Motion, for in≈øtance, if it be long, tho' only moderate, it is dangerous and great; for ≈øuch an one wa≈øtes the Strength by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and at length kills.</p>
               <p>As to the Length and Shortne≈øs of a Di≈øea≈øe, they may be known chiefly by three things. Fir≈øt, By the Species of the Di≈øea≈øe, ≈øo an Apoplexy, Plague, an ephemeral Fever, are known to be ≈øhort; a quartan Ague, Pal≈øy, and the like, are known to be long. Secondly, By the Magnitude of the Di≈øea≈øe, ≈øo you know a Di≈øea≈øe in it ≈øelf great, or comparatively ≈øo, does not la≈øt long. Thirdly, From the manner of the Di≈øea≈øe, ≈øo you may know a Di≈øea≈øe will not la≈øt long, that has unu≈øual and violent Symptoms. The Progno≈øtics taken from the≈øe Signs are not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Sea≈øon of the Year, ≈øo Di≈øea≈øes in the Autumn and Winter are wont to be longer than Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes in the Spring and Summer, by rea≈øon of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Matter, and the greater Apertion of the Body.</p>
               <p>A critical Sign is that which ≈øignifies a <hi>Cri≈øis.</hi> It is wont to be reckoned threefold, demon≈øtrative, prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øtic, and commemorative.</p>
               <p>A critical demon≈øtrative Sign is a great Loo≈øene≈øs, or a large Hemorrhage at the No≈øe, as they make ≈øome Change in the Di≈øea≈øe. A critical progno≈øtic Sign is a great Pain of the Head, Redne≈øs of the Face, as they ≈øignifie a Hemorrhage of the No≈øe. A commemorative critical Sign is the better Di≈øpo≈øition of the ≈øick, after the <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> is made.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:63575:64"/>
               <p>A <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> is the ≈øudden Change of a Di≈øea≈øe, either for Life or Death, it is divided into good and bad, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo into perfect and imperfect. A good <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> is for Life, a bad <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> for Death. A <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> that is perfect, perfectly carries off the Di≈øea≈øe.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> is not perfect in our Country, becau≈øe our Region is cold, and the Humours are cold, but the chief rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the Practice in the≈øe Parts is ≈øuch, as does not commit much to Nature; but we do at the Beginning carry off, or at lea≈øt le≈ø≈øen the Cau≈øe of the Di≈øea≈øe, by bleeding, or gentle purging, or by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that move Urine or Sweat, or the like. Yet, notwith≈øtanding, a <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> does ≈øometimes happen here; for ≈øometimes we ≈øee, that Fevers are ≈øometime carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off by Sweat, a Loo≈øene≈øs, or bleeding at the No≈øe.</p>
               <p>The Cau≈øe of a <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> is a violent Influx of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits into the Fibres of ≈øome Part, whereby the Part contracting it ≈øelf, expels the Cau≈øe of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, or our Heat, or the Motion of the Blood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Cau≈øe of the Di≈øea≈øe con≈øi≈øts, is detruded to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Parts; and if this or that Protru≈øion of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øic Matter be ≈øuch, that thereby it be wholly elimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Body, the <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> is perfect. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents a≈ø≈øigned certain Days for a good and perfect <hi>Cri≈øis,</hi> and ≈øo much depended on them, that they did not fear a Relap≈øe, when the <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> happened on any of the≈øe Days; and ≈øome of the≈øe Days they called <hi>Indices,</hi> or <hi>Contemplabiles,</hi> becau≈øe then they were to ≈øee whether the Signs of Concoction did appear in the Excrements, and ≈øo promi≈øe a good <hi>Cri≈øis:</hi> Others they called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicentes,</hi> in which no <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> was made; but there was a Provocation of Nature to a <hi>Cri≈øis.</hi> La≈øtly, Of the≈øe they called ≈øome void Days, wherein no <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> was made, nor was there any Provocation of Nature to it. The≈øe they al≈øo called medicinal, becau≈øe they counted it lawful to give Medicines at this Time.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63575:64"/>But ≈øeeing it appears from their Writings, that a good <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> has been made of any Day, and becau≈øe there is no rea≈øon why tho≈øe Days ≈øhould be only cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, we attribute no more to them, than we do to climateric Years, that ≈øo much terrifie rich and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Men, and to bi≈ø≈øextile Years, that frighten Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child.</p>
               <p>There are ≈øuch great Differences of the Pul≈øe among Authors, that it is impo≈ø≈øible to di≈øtingui≈øh them; wherefore I ≈øhall only ≈øet down tho≈øe that are u≈øeful in Practice, and the≈øe Differences are four, great and ≈ømall, ≈øtrong and weak, equal and unequal, frequent and rare. A great Pul≈øe is when the Artery beats much, long, broad, and deep, a ≈ømall Pul≈øe is, when the Artery does not beat much, nor long, broad, and deep; you mu≈øt always under≈øtand proportionable to the Body; for the Pul≈øe of the Body may be great with re≈øpect to it, tho' it be really le≈øs than in a Man. The Cau≈øe of a great Pul≈øe is a great Quantity of Blood, or a great Rarefaction of it in the Arteries. A great Pul≈øe, as to it ≈øelf, fignifies Strength, and is a good Sign, and on the contrary, a ≈ømall Pul≈øe ≈øignifies Weakne≈øs, Death, or at lea≈øt a long Continuance of the Di≈øea≈øe: But you mu≈øt not think that a great Pul≈øe is always be≈øt; for it is to be ≈øu≈øpected ≈øometimes, as in tho≈øe that are plethoric; for the great Con≈øtriction of the Heart oftner proceeds from too great an Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, than from the Strength of the Faculty; wherefore a moderate Pul≈øe is be≈øt.</p>
               <p>The Pul≈øe is ≈øtrong when the Artery ≈øtrikes the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hard upon touching. The Pul≈øe is weak, when the Artery ≈øtrikes the Finger weakly. A ≈øtrong Pul≈øe proceeds from a ≈øtrong Con≈øtriction of the Heart, and from a ≈øtrong Cour≈øe of the Blood into the Arteries; and therefore is a good Sign; namely, it ≈øhews Strength, and a brisk Influx of the animal Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heart, it ≈øhews al≈øo the Shortne≈øs of the Di≈øea≈øe;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63575:65"/>for where ≈øuch a Pul≈øe is, the Body the ea≈øier clean≈øes it ≈øelf from the morbific Matter. An equal Pul≈øe is when the Pul≈øe equally ≈øtrikes the Finger touching it. A frequent Pul≈øe is when it frequently ≈øtrikes the Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er touching it. The Cau≈øes of a frequent Pul≈øe are a Di≈øpo≈øition of the Blood to rarifie pre≈øently in the Heart, the Tenuity of it, and the previous Rarity. A rare Pul≈øe flows from contrary Cau≈øes, it is ill in Youth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Age, but wor≈øt, when it is weak as well as rare.</p>
               <p>A Pul≈øe proper to a hot Temperament, is wont to be great and frequent, and often ≈øtrong. A Pul≈øe proper to a cold Temperament is ≈ømall, ≈ølow, and weak: A Pul≈øe proper to a dry Temperament is rate and ≈øomewhat hard. A Pul≈øe proper to a moi≈øt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament is ≈øomewhat great, rare, and ≈øoft. From what has been ≈øaid, it is ea≈øie to judge of Pul≈øes proper to compounded Temperaments, as hot and dry, hot and moi≈øt, cold and dry, cold and moi≈øt.</p>
               <p>Childrens Pul≈øe are very quick, and ≈øomewhat ≈øoft; for their Blood is very thin, and their Heart is very tender. In Youths and Men, the Pul≈øe is very great, and very ≈øtrong, in Women the Pul≈øe is quick and ≈øoft, ≈øometimes great, but mo≈øt commonly ≈ømall, for their Heat is weak. Old People have a rare and weak Pul≈øe, by rea≈øon their Heat is languid. In the Spring the Pul≈øe is wont to be ≈øtrong, great, and moderately quick, for the Blood abounds by rea≈øon of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Winter, and the Heat is moderate. In the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the Pul≈øe is quick, ≈øomewhat great, and ≈øtrong, becau≈øe the Blood rarifies better, and the Heat is more. In Autumn the Pul≈øe is incon≈øtant and weak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Heat is le≈ø≈øened, and by rea≈øon of the frequent Variation of the State of the Air. In the Winter the Pul≈øe is ≈ømall, weak, and rare, for in Winter the Heat langui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by rea≈øon of Sero≈øity, and is le≈ø≈øened by the Air. In Sleep the Pul≈øe is languid, rare, and ≈ømall, for the Heat is then ≈ømall: But when any one awakes, the Pul≈øe is increa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63575:65"/>and is very unequal, becau≈øe the Spirits ru≈øh from the Brain into the Nerves of the Heart. In Anger the Pul≈øe is great, ≈øtrong, and frequent; becau≈øe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are carried plentifully and violently into the Heart. In Sorrow the Pul≈øe is ≈ømall, weak, and rare, becau≈øe the Spirits langui≈øh in the Brain. In Mirth the Pul≈øe is moderately great, ≈øtrong, and equal. The Pul≈øe proper for Love is more difficultly known; for it is compounded of ≈øeveral Pul≈øes, of diver≈øe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Mind; yet any one may know Love by the Pul≈øe, if Signs of Di≈øea≈øes being ab≈øent, the Pul≈øe is very unequal and inordinate; for the Spirits are wont to move very irregularly both in the Brain and out of it; for ≈øometimes they are merry, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ≈øad, ≈øometimes they fear, and ≈øometimes they hope well.</p>

               <p>WE treat only here of the Urine, as an Effect, ≈øhewing its Cau≈øe in the Body, and ≈øo taken, it ≈øhews the Temper of the Body, or ≈øomething particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar about the Parts of it, thro' which the <hi>Serum</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually flows; for by them it is varied in Sub≈øtance or Quality; but the In≈øpection of the Urine is be≈øt after Chylification is perfectly made, and therefore it is be≈øt to ≈øee it after Sleep in a Morning. You mu≈øt put it into a clear and thin Gla≈øs, that is round at Bottom; but it mu≈øt not be viewed after Coition, Watching, Purging, or after U≈øe of Medicines that affect the Urine, and it mu≈øt not be viewed as ≈øoon as voided, nor too long after; but as ≈øoon as it is cold, and has a Sediment. You ought to view it in a clear Air.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:63575:66"/>
               <p>If any one ≈øhall bring to a Phy≈øician, with De≈øign to deceive him, the Urine of a Brute, or any thing el≈øe, in≈øtead of Man's Water, the Cheat is be≈øt di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Smell.</p>
               <p>Every Di≈øea≈øe cannot be known by the Urine, tho' Pi≈øs-prophets pretend they are able to know all by it; for a Giddine≈øs of the Head, a Wound of a certain Part, a Pal≈øy, Luxation, and many other Di≈øea≈øes cannot be known by it, tho' ≈øomething may be brought to the Reins and Bladder from every Part: But the Con≈øtitutions, Good or Ill of tho≈øe Parts, wherein the Urine is perfected, generated, or ≈øomewhat altered, are chiefly known by the Urine, as of the Vi≈øcera ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for Concoction of the Blood, Heart, Ureters, and Reins; therefore I ≈øay that Urine is a very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diagno≈øtic Sign, and more general than the Pul≈øe, becau≈øe it often di≈øcovers the Di≈øea≈øe, the Cau≈øe of it, and the Part affected; but the Pul≈øe does not ≈øo; for by the Urine we know Di≈øea≈øes, as Ulcers, Wounds, Ob≈øtructions, and the Intemperies of the inner Parts; by the Urine we know the Cau≈øes, as Vi≈øcidity, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, Choler, Stones, Sand, Clods of Blood, and the like. By the Urine we know the Part affected, as the Bladder affected by Scales or fetid Pus mixed with the Urine. We know the Reins are affected by Caruncles, Blood and Pus coming away with the Urine. We know that the Bladder of the Gaul is affected by the Urine being pale for a long while: But none of the≈øe are found by the Pul≈øe, yet the Pul≈øe is a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sign of Life or Death, for it ≈øhews the primary Cau≈øes of Life, whether they are well or ill, as the Influx of the animal Spirits from the Brain to the Heart, the Temper of the Heart, Blood, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of them.</p>
               <p>Urine al≈øo often ≈øhews Death, as an I≈øchury by the Defect of it in a <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> by the Aquo≈øity of it; in an Ulcer of the Bladder, by Pus mixed with it, in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63575:66"/>the Plague, by the Blackne≈øs of it, and its variegated Colour, and the like: But we mu≈øt not progno≈øticate any thing ra≈øhly by the In≈øpection of the Urine: For ≈øometimes, in the mo≈øt dangerous Di≈øea≈øes, and when the Pul≈øe are ill, the Urine appears good, and yet the Patient dyes notwith≈øtanding; wherefore it is very fallacious.</p>
               <p>The chief Colours which are ob≈øerved in Urine, are the≈øe four, white, red, yellow, black. The general Cau≈øes of Colours in Urine are the Heat continually boyling, and working upon the Aliment, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and Guts, and upon the Chyle mixed with the Blood. That Heat is the Cau≈øe of the Colour in Urine is very manife≈øt from Fevers, the Heat of the Air, Labour, long Retention of it in the Body, and the like; and we ≈øee that by Heat Beer grows redder, and that Rheni≈øh Wine carried into <hi>Spain</hi> looks more yellow, and Urine boyled over the Fire grows very red.</p>
               <p>White Urine is twofold, one thin, called watery, the other thick, called milky. The Cau≈øe of a watry Urine is weak Heat, as in ≈øuch as are cachectical, and hydropical, large Drinking, too ≈øhort a Continuance of it in the Body by rea≈øon of the Laxity of the Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; for ≈øo ≈øuch a due Chylification and Sanguificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be made, as to tincture the Urine. An Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of the Pa≈ø≈øages, as we ≈øee in a Stone of the Kidnies. La≈øtly, Choler, by rea≈øon it is carried to the Head by being thin and light, as we ≈øee it is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very ≈øuddenly in Fevers, and then it betokens a <hi>Delirium.</hi> The Cau≈øe of a milky Urine is the Mixture of ≈øome white Humour with it, as Flegm, Seed, Pus, and the like.</p>
               <p>A yellow Urine is cau≈øed by a due Concoction of the Chyle with the Blood. A red Urine is made by the Mixture of Blood with it, or by a greater Coction. Blood is mixed with the Urine, either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63575:67"/>of the Tenuity of it, or by rea≈øon of a Rupture of a Ve≈ø≈øel in the Reins, or Bladder, or the like. A black Urine, and other Species of it, ≈øignifie the Adu≈ø≈øe on or Corruption of the Humours in the Body. The Urine often changes Colour, and ≈øo when 'tis voided red, being expo≈øed to the Air, it ≈øometimes, a little after, turns brown or yellow, and this comes to pa≈øs by the divers Reflection of the Light.</p>
               <p>The Urine never ≈ømells plea≈øantly unle≈øs ≈øome odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous thing be taken in, as Musk or the like, yet the natural Smell is not very ≈øtinking tho ≈øtrong and ≈øulphureous, and if it be without, it argues Debility of Heat, or that the Urine has not continued long enough in the Body. If the Urine ≈øtink much (unle≈øs ≈øtinking things have been taken in, as putrid Chee≈øe, Garlic, or the like) it ≈øignifies the Corruption of ≈øome Humour, or the Ulceration of ≈øome Part, e≈øpecially if Pus be mixt with it. But Urine that has Pus mixt with it, does not nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øtink, for often Pus it ≈øelf, coming from an Impo≈øtume, ≈øcarce ≈ømells, and much le≈øs when it is mixt with Urine. But it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt from Experience, that Matter made in the Reins or Bladder, ≈øtinks much, and is gro≈øs and vi≈øcid.</p>
               <p>The Ta≈øte of the Urine is ≈øalt and nitrous, as is the <hi>Serum</hi> whereof it is chiefly con≈øtituted, if it has any other Ta≈øt, it proceeds from the Mixture of another Humour, and ≈øignifies that ≈øuch an Humour abounds in the Body. But you will ≈øay, it is below a Phy≈øician to ta≈øte: Urine I an≈øwer, the Phy≈øician need not ta≈øte the Urine, for the Patient him≈øelf may do it.</p>
               <p>The Quantity of the Urine is either the Abundance or Paucity of it. The Quantity in the natural State, is proportionable to the liquid Matter taken in, yet ≈øomewhat le≈øs, perhaps about a third, for ≈øome Part of it continually pa≈ø≈øes into Nouri≈øhment, and ≈øome Part is evacuated in≈øen≈øibly, or by Sweat, or by Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ≈øome ought to remain in the Blood to dilute it, or to be a Vehicle for it.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:63575:67"/>
               <p>a great Quantity of Urine, unle≈øs it be occa≈øioned by Cold ob≈øtructing in≈øen≈øible Tran≈øpiration, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of taking Diureticks, Drop≈øie, Rheumati≈øm, or by the <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> of a Fever, whereby the Cau≈øe of the Di≈øea≈øe is carried off, ≈øignifies a Debility of the urina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pa≈ø≈øages, and the Laxity of them, and as the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the future wa≈øting of the Body, as in a <hi>Diabetes.</hi> A ≈ømall Quantity of Urine, unle≈øs it proceeds from a Defect of liquid things taken in, ≈øignifies great Heat di≈ø≈øipating the <hi>Serum,</hi> by in≈øen≈øible Tran≈øpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sweat, or the like, and is often ≈øeen in Fevers; or it ≈øignifies an Ob≈øtruction of the urinary Pa≈ø≈øages, a Drop≈øie of ≈øome Part, a Rheumati≈øm, Catarrh, or the like.</p>
               <p>The natural Con≈øi≈øtence of Urine is like that of Beer, moderately and duely boyl'd and fermented.</p>
               <p>A gro≈øs Urine ari≈øes from a Defect of Sero≈øity, or by ≈øome thick thing mixed with it, as it happens ≈øometimes at the Beginning of Fevers, and in Children that eat too much.</p>
               <p>A thin Urine proceeds from an Ob≈øtruction of the Urinary Pa≈ø≈øages, and ≈øo by rea≈øon of the Stone in the Kidneys it is thin, or by rea≈øon of the Weakne≈øs of the natural Heat.</p>
               <p>That which is contained in the Urine is that Body which is ob≈øervable in the Sub≈øtance of the Urine. It is univer≈øally threefold, the Hypo≈øta≈øis, which ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides to the Bottom; the Eneorema which is ≈øu≈øpended in the Middle, and the Nubecula which is on the Top: Of the≈øe none ought to be in the Urine of a well Per≈øon, but the Hypo≈øta≈øis, which ≈øignifies that Concoction is made, and if it be of a whiti≈øh, and of a round Figure, and equal, it is be≈øt.</p>
               <p>That which is particularly contained in the Urine is either a Stone, Sand, Matter, Blood, Caruncles, Fat, or a brawny Sediment; and mo≈øt of the≈øe ≈øignifie a Di≈øpo≈øition to the Stone in the Kidnies, or in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63575:68"/>Fat ≈øignifies a wa≈øting of the Body, and is often ≈øeen upon the Top of the Urine of con≈øumptive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As to the Sand, it is not as ≈øome think always Fragments of a greater Stone, but a certain Concrete of Salt in the Urine.</p>
               <p>Becau≈øe the ordinary People, and ≈øome of the better Sort have been a long while, and are ≈øtill much abu≈øed by Quacks, Empericks, and ≈øome methodical Phi≈øicians, who pretend to the Knowledge of all Di≈øea≈øes, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpection of the Urine, I ≈øhall here make appear, that there is no certain Knowledge of many Di≈øea≈øes to be gathered from the Urine alone, and that it is better for the Phy≈øician to ≈øee his Patient once, than to view his Urine twenty times: And ≈øeveral learned Phy≈øicians have likewi≈øe written diver≈øe Tracts therein, di≈øcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dangers of taking Phy≈øick pre≈øcribed only by the Sight of the Urine, to the end that they might di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈øs Men of that fond Opinion of a Phy≈øician's di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Di≈øea≈øes by it, wherewith they have been ≈øo long time deluded; and one of the≈øe, in ≈øhewing the Fal≈øhood and uncertain Judgment of Di≈øea≈øes by the Urine, hath ≈øet down the ingenious Confe≈ø≈øion of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phy≈øician, made to him, being then pre≈øent with him ≈øome three or four Days before his Departure, who being reque≈øted to leave to Po≈øterity that Skill whereby he had been ≈øo much admired and e≈øteemed for judging Women to be with Child by their Urine, made this An≈øwer; I have, ≈øaid he, with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plau≈øe, exerci≈øed it, and found, by much Experience, that it is a great Cheat; and therefore not worthy to be counted an Art, and unfit to be communicated to Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Another of them makes al≈øo this fair Confe≈ø≈øion. Says he, I have been ≈øo fortunate herein, that I have ≈øeldom failed in my Predictions of determining a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be with Child by the Urine, as I have made them believe, when the Me≈ø≈øenger has been able to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie me of the State of the Woman's Body, and could
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63575:68"/>an≈øwer me to certain other Que≈øtions touching other Signs of Conception. Above all the re≈øt, I was once magnified by a Coun≈øellours Wife, for this cunning Cheat; ≈øhe meeting with two other Doctors, ≈øhe told them to their Faces, that I was the cunninge≈øt Doctor in all the Town; for I had told her, by her Water, that ≈øhe was with Child, and ju≈øt how long it was ≈øince ≈øhe conceived of it: But had the Woman that brought the Urine, ≈øhewed me no more than the Urine did, I ≈øhould ≈øcarce have ventured to have pronounced her to have been with Child: But I, ≈øaid he, am more to be blamed for my jugling, than ≈øhe for her Credulity.</p>
               <p>Notwith≈øtanding what has been ≈øaid, the vulgar Sort are ≈øo ≈øtrongly prepo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by rea≈øon of their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that Phy≈øicians can di≈øcern, by the Urine, the Di≈øea≈øe, the Conception, the Sex, the Parties Age, with many other ≈øuch Ab≈øurdities, that I fear it will be a hard Matter to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs them of that Opinion; and Phy≈øicians, the more to blame they, have intimated and pretended ≈øo much to this Knowledge, that they will hardly acknowledge their Errors, and relinqui≈øh this Cheat: But when it ≈øhall appear that the Urine is deceitful, and the Phy≈øician that pretends Knowledge of Di≈øea≈øes thereby, and gives his Judgment by ≈øuch Fallacies and Jugling, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed in the en≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Di≈øcour≈øe, let the ignorant chu≈øe whether he will believe his lying Oracle or no, and let the Phy≈øician chu≈øe whether he will be hone≈øter than to u≈øe ≈øuch Deceit. Yet I hope the one will blu≈øh to have been ≈øo deluded, and the other to have his conjecturing di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the Urine giving no certain Knowledge of mo≈øt Di≈øea≈øes.</p>
               <p>Di≈øea≈øes are either acute or chronical,; acute are a Pleuri≈øy, Peripneumonia, Frenzy, Iliac Pa≈ø≈øion, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Small Pox, Pe≈øtilence, and the like. Chronical Di≈øea≈øes are ≈øuch as proceed from the ill Temperature of the Humours, and Di≈øpo≈øition of the Con≈øtitution
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63575:69"/>of the Body, ≈øuch are a Con≈øumption, Drop≈øie, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, Gout, Pal≈øy, Falling Sickne≈øs, Cachexy, and the like; but for the mo≈øt part, the common fort of People come or ≈øend their Water to Phy≈øicians for acute Di≈øea≈øes, and acute Di≈øea≈øes have always a hot and burning Fever joined with them, and the Urine, for the mo≈øt part, in a burning Fever, is of a high red Colour, and ≈øuch an Urine being brought to the Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to ca≈øt, as they call it, and being of a red high Colour, he pre≈øently conceives it to be a ≈øharp and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Di≈øea≈øe, and then knows for certain that there is a Fever joined with it, and ≈øo he is quickly prepared to give his Judgment of it, and needs now do no more but give a De≈øcription of a Fever to make the Me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger believe that he perceives a Di≈øea≈øe in the Water, ye he comes to the true Knowledge of the Di≈øea≈øe by ≈øome ≈øuch Parly and Expo≈øtulation with the Me≈ø≈øenger, as ≈øhews the Symptoms and Affects of the ≈øick Party. Now the De≈øcription of a Fever, and indeed one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription will ≈øerve for any Fever, and for all ≈øharp and violent Di≈øea≈øes, is to reckon up the Symptoms and Signs of a Fever, which he knows before he looks upon the Water: They are the≈øe, Oppre≈ø≈øion of the Stomach, Want of Appetite, a great Pain in the Head and Back, and the like. Now the ≈øaying ≈øo makes the Me≈ø≈øenger think that the Doctor perceives by the Urine that the Party is ≈øo affected, yet it is no ≈øuch Matter; for a high colour'd Urine is not always the infallible Sign of a Fever; but ≈øuppo≈øe it were, yet the Symptoms and Companions of a Fever, as Heat, Thir≈øt, Pain in the Head, and Want of Sleep, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion of the Stomach, Want of Appetite, and the like, are not to be ≈øeen in the Water.</p>
               <p>The≈øe things being premi≈øed, I hope thou wilt be the better able to judge of that which follows, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how ea≈øie a thing it is to give Judgment of Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes by the Urine, tho' it be not there to be ≈øeen, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63575:69"/>will perceive the Fallacies that uphold this Cu≈øtom, and ≈øo learn to di≈øtingui≈øh betwixt an hone≈øt, learned, plain-dealing Phy≈øician, and a chearing Ca≈øter of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Me≈ø≈øenger, whether Man or Woman, you mu≈øt note, is one who is as it were made out of Wax, and the Phy≈øician can mould him into any Form that ≈øhall fit his Purpo≈øe be≈øt, and make him, by impertinent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtions, as he thinks, to tell him any thing concerning the ≈øick Party, that he ≈øhall de≈øire to know.</p>
               <p>The Urine, if brought out of the Country, is for the mo≈øt part in a Gla≈øs Bottle: But if ones in the City, it is brought in an Urinal or Viol, it is red and high coloured; and therefore the Pi≈øs-prophet rips up all the Symptoms of a Fever, as before, and the Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenger pre≈øently an≈øwers that the Party is ju≈øt ≈øo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I ≈øaid: But as yet he has not named the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, and perhaps omitted ≈øomething, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he ≈øhould have named, and the Me≈ø≈øenger is ready then to ask him, if he perceived nothing el≈øe in the Water; to whom he an≈øwers, yes, if you'll give me leave to tell you; and perhaps the Me≈ø≈øenger asks if he do not perceive a Stitch, then the Pi≈øs-pot Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer an≈øwers, looking upon the Water, as if it were there to be perceived, yes, I well perceive the Stitch, and ≈øome Cough too, and he ≈øays, when the Cough take; the Party, the Party is much pained in the Side; and becau≈øe he did not fir≈øt name the Stitch, he tells the Me≈ø≈øenger, that we fir≈øt u≈øe to declare the Cau≈øe of the Di≈øea≈øe, before we come to every Pa≈ø≈øion, or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Di≈øea≈øe, or before we name it. He further adds, that he was not come to ≈øpeak of the Stitch, becau≈øe he had named the Oppre≈ø≈øion of the Stomach, and the Ob≈øtruction of the Spleen and Me≈øentery, and that the Stitch was nothing el≈øe, but a ≈ølatulous and windy Humour proceeding thence to the Part affected. And now having been ≈øo happy in his Predictions of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63575:70"/>the Di≈øea≈øe, and rightly determined it to be a Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie, ≈øo now he proceeds to the Pre≈øcription of ≈øuch Remedies as may cure this Pleuri≈øie, and yet here he is as far to ≈øeek, tho' he know the Di≈øea≈øe to be a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øie, as if he knew not the Di≈øea≈øe at all, nor had ≈øeen the Urine, becau≈øe he does not therein perceive the Scope and Grounds of pre≈øcribing fit Remedies, in every Re≈øpect, proper to the Di≈øea≈øe, according to the Rules of Art, the which Scope and Grounds are the≈øe, namely, the Parties Age, the Sex, the Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Body, and the Strength of it at this Time, with divers other Accidents, as whether the Party be bound in his Body, or have a Flux, or the like; all which, nor any one of them can be di≈øcerned by the Urine, and ≈øo he mu≈øt needs err in his Pre≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the Me≈ø≈øenger refu≈øe, or be unable to give him a full account of the Ca≈øe; for if not knowing the Age of the Party, he ≈øhould order ≈øuch a Quantity of Blood to be taken away from a Youth, ≈øuppo≈øe Ten or Twelve Ounces, in a Pleuri≈øie, the Di≈øea≈øe in Hand, as ≈øhould be taken from a Man in his full Strength, the Party might peri≈øh thereby: Or if he ≈øhould take but four or five Ounces of Blood from a lu≈øty young Man in this Di≈øea≈øe, he would do him no good, and ≈øo he might peri≈øh on the other hand. He may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe err in the Do≈øe, by pro≈øcribing more or le≈øs than is proportionable to the Party's Age. He may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe err as much by not knowing the Sex, if he ≈øhould in the forenamed Di≈øea≈øe pre≈øcribe Blood-letting to a Woman, when ≈øhe has her natural Cour≈øes upon her; for thereby there may be a Solution of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe without bleeding. He may likewi≈øe err, if not knowing the Sex, he ≈øhould pre≈øcribe purging Phy≈øick for a Woman with Child; he may al≈øo err upon the Account of the Con≈øtitution of the Patient, and Time of the Di≈øea≈øe.

               <p>In the next place I ≈øhall ≈øhew how many Ways the≈øe fal≈øe Prophets have to deceive the People, and to make them believe that they di≈øcern all things by the Urine, namely, the Di≈øea≈øe, the Parties Age, Sex, Strength, Con≈øtitution of the Body, and the like. Suppo≈øe the next Me≈ø≈øenger to be ≈øome Nur≈øe, or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ≈øick Per≈øons; who is commonly ver≈øed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øtomed to carry ≈øick Per≈øons Urines to Phy≈øicians; and as the Pi≈øs-lecturer is taking the Urinal out of the Ca≈øe, he asks the Nur≈øe how long the Party hath been ≈øick; and ≈øhe, out of Mode≈øty and good Manners, can do no le≈øs than an≈øwer him to this Que≈øtion; for ≈øhe thinks this Que≈øtion to be Words of cour≈øe, and that he can gather nothing from hence touching the Parties Di≈øea≈øe; ≈øo ≈øhe an≈øwers him, a Week, a Fortnight, two or three Days, more or le≈øs, and hence he collects and has a ≈øtrong Pre≈øumption, that it is an acute Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe. Having askt this Que≈øtion, and lookt upon the Urine, he ≈øays this Party has a great Oppre≈ø≈øion of the Stomach, has no Appetite, a great Ob≈øtruction of the Liver and Spleen, is very hot and thir≈øty, and has a great Pain in the Head, and can take no Re≈øt, and was ≈øeized in the manner of an Ague, fir≈øt cold, then hor, as he ≈øaid in giving his Judgment on the la≈øt Urine; and indeed, this De≈øcription will ≈øerve for any acute Di≈øea≈øe, whether it be the Pleuri≈øie, the Small-pox, Mea≈øles, a Fit of the Stone in the Kidnies, Quin≈øy, Frenzy, the Iliac Pa≈ø≈øion, or any other acute Di≈øea≈øe, wherewith a Fever is always complicated; or whether it be a ≈øimple Fever, which is primarily the Di≈øea≈øe it ≈øelf; but yet he will not always u≈øe the ≈øame De≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becau≈øe divers Me≈ø≈øengers may come to a Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and may ≈øtay, for Companies ≈øake, to go away together, and may fall to que≈øtioning each other, what the Doctor ≈øaid to them, and ≈øo may think, if he ≈øhould u≈øe the ≈øame De≈øcription to them all, that he could ≈øay nothing el≈øe; therefore he ≈øometimes varies
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63575:71"/>his De≈øcription, and ≈øometimes is ≈øhorter in the ≈øame; and then, if he find, by an Expo≈øtulation with the Me≈ø≈øenger, that he has omitted any thing that he ≈øhould have ≈øpoken to, he ≈øays, it proceeded from ≈øuch a Cau≈øe as he had already named, and that he ≈øhould have come to ≈øpeak of that anon. He is ≈øometimes likewi≈øe larger in his De≈øcription, as herein relating how the Party is affected, from whom this Nur≈øe comes, and ≈øhe is as ready to take him up for the ≈øame, and ≈øays, it is true indeed, that the Party can take no Re≈øt, has no Appetite to Meat, and was ≈øeized in the manner of an Ague, but complains not of his Stomach at all, but cries out, my Head, my Head, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains altogether for want of Re≈øt; he replies, that the Pain of the Head is the chief of the Pa≈ø≈øions that the Party is affected with, but yet that it proceeded from the Ob≈øtruction of the Stomach, and Oppilation of the Liver and Spleen, which ≈øend choleric Fumes to the Brain, which inflame the animal Spirits, and cau≈øe this Pain that hinders Re≈øt, and that if Re≈øt be not obtained, the Party will rave and be frantic. Thus, having an≈øwered this Objection, he now begins to touch the Urinal, to ≈øee if it be ≈øettled: But finding it not ≈øettled enough to his purpo≈øe, to ≈øhew tho≈øe things he mu≈øt find out of it, he ≈øets it down again very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, ≈øaying, it mu≈øt yet ≈øettle a little better, and then he falls to que≈øtion the Nur≈øe concerning ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may ≈øhew the Sex, for he mu≈øt find out that by the Water too, and therefore he asks her what the Party u≈øed to do in the Time of Health, and this is a Que≈øtion that may, ≈øhe thinks, as well be an≈øwered without giving him any Light of the Sex, as the former Que≈øtion, which was how long the Party had been ≈øick, of giving him any Light of the Di≈øea≈øe. But you ≈øhall hear what he collects from thence; ≈øhe an≈øwers, he demanding what the Party u≈øes to do, that the Party u≈øes to do little, ≈øave only to go up and down
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63575:71"/>the Hou≈øe, to work about the Hou≈øe, to walk up and down abroad, to keep a Shop, to labour, or the like; and from all the≈øe he makes ≈øeveral Ob≈øervations; for if ≈øhe ≈øay that the Party u≈øes to do little, ≈øave only to go up and down the Hou≈øe, he pre≈øumes that it is the Mi≈øtri≈øs of the Hou≈øe, or one of her Daughters, or ≈øome Gentlewoman in the Hou≈øe; for certain it is a Womans Water; for they ≈øhould, and commonly do keep their Hou≈øe, and their Work is to walk up and down the Hou≈øe. But if ≈øhe ≈øay the Party u≈øes to do ≈øuch Work as is to be done in or about the Hou≈øe, it is mo≈øt likely that it is a Maid Servant; but if ≈øhe ≈øay to walk abroad, he then pre≈øumes it is a Man's Water, and that it may be the Ma≈øter of the Hou≈øe, or his Son, or ≈øome other Gentleman's, who≈øe EMployment is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to walk abroad and take his Plea≈øure. But if ≈øhe ≈øay to keep a Shop, he ≈øuppo≈øes it to be the Mi≈øtri≈øs thereof, or the Apprentices; or if ≈øhe ≈øay that the Party u≈øes to labour, he imagins it to be a Man-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; ≈øo by her An≈øwer to this Que≈øtion, namely, what the Party u≈øes to do in time of Health, he di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Sex, and now taking the Urinal again in his Hand, for by this time it has ≈øtood long enough to ≈øettle, he ≈øays that it is a Womans Water, if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to the Que≈øtion, what the Party u≈øed to do in Time of Health did infer as much; that ≈øhe has a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fever, and is ≈øo dangerou≈øly ≈øick, that will hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, unle≈øs ≈øuch and ≈øuch ≈øpeedy Means be u≈øed; and this Danger he always pretends in every violent Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, tho' there be no deadly Sign at all, but not to the ≈øick Parties; for that they cannot endure to hear of, but ≈øecretly to the Me≈ø≈øenger, or ≈øome near Friend or By-≈øtander, if he be pre≈øent with them; and then, if the Party live, his Judgment will not be ≈øo much as que≈øtioned for ≈øaying the Party will dye; but be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for that he has recovered her of a dangerous Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe; nay, to be ≈øure, be happy in his Predictions and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63575:72"/>Progno≈øticks concerning Life and Death of the Patient; for they mu≈øt always have a Hint of that, tho' the Thoughts of Death be unwelcome; but he always ≈øays if ≈øuch and ≈øuch Means be u≈øed, ≈øhe may happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; and now he has performed his Part well enough to the Nur≈øe in his Progno≈øticks concerning the Event of the Woman's Sickne≈øs, from whom ≈øhe is come. He has told her how the Woman is affected, what the Di≈øea≈øe is, and what will be the Event, and the Nur≈øe is rea≈øonably well ≈øatisfied herewith: But yet he has omitted ≈øomething that ≈øhe will be ≈øure to tell him of; for ≈øince ≈øhe has undertaken the Matter, ≈øhe will not go without her Errand; and therefore asks him if he perceives nothing el≈øe by the Water? And he imagines well enough what it is el≈øe that he ≈øhould perceive in the Water; for when that Que≈øtion is propounded, it is to know whether the Woman be with Child or no: He an≈øwers, that there are many more things to be perceived by the Water, but not at all times, as whether a Woman be with Child or not, which is that you look for; but it is not now to be ≈øeen in this Water; becau≈øe her Body is all out of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and her Water troubled and di≈øcoloured, yet he thinks her with Child, and well he may, if ≈øhe her ≈øelf think ≈øo: But he further tells her, that he could have certainly told if ≈øhe had brought her Water in the Time of her Health; and ≈øo ≈øhe is ≈øatisfied for that Matter, and confe≈ø≈øes that ≈øhe is with Child indeed. Having thus ≈øatisfied her in all the≈øe things, told her that it is a Woman's Water, in what manner ≈øhe was ≈øick, what was her Di≈øea≈øe, that it was likely ≈øhe was with Child, which proves true, and that ≈øhe would ≈øcarce recover: He asks her who≈øe Water it is; but ≈øhe will not tell that by any means; for ≈øhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to di≈øcover it, and indeed ≈øhe was ≈øent only to hear his Opinion of the Water, the which if ≈øhe like, he may perhaps hear further from the Party; but if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63575:72"/>not, ≈øhe is ordered to go to another Doctor, and ≈øo if ≈øhe like not his Opinion neither, from him to another, until ≈øhe comes to him that hits the Di≈øea≈øe righte≈øt, as ≈øhe conceives by the Water, and it is a great chance if he be not the greate≈øt Fool and Knave of all the three. This is the Man that mu≈øt be made choice of to cure the Woman, and this is thought great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in making Choice of an able Phy≈øician; it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behoves him to be a Crafts Ma≈øter in this Art; fore el≈øe you ≈øee here, he is like to be chou≈øed of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to have his Skill call'd in que≈øtion; for if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the Di≈øea≈øe by the Water, they ≈øoon conclude he does not know how to cure it; the Nur≈øe tells him indeed, that ≈øhe came to hear his Opinion of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the ≈øick Party would ≈øend to him again, when ≈øhe had heard (≈øhe ≈øhould have ≈øaid if ≈øhe liked it) what was his Opinion, and I think he has fitted her; and now he tells the Nur≈øe, that ≈øhe ≈øhould make ha≈øte home, and bids her be ≈øure to deliver his Opinion as he told her, and to tell ≈øome of her near Friends how dangerou≈øly ≈øick ≈øhe is, and that he would, if ≈øhe think good to make u≈øe of him, u≈øe the be≈øt Means that Art affords to recover her, and now he bids her make all the Ha≈øte that may be; but yet before he lets her go, he thus be≈øpeaks her; really Nur≈øe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee that thou wilt do thy Errand hand≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and make a Phy≈øician find the Di≈øea≈øe out by the Water, and not be gulled to tell how the Party was affected, as many a Fool would have done: But I hope I have ≈øhewed thee truly, how the Party is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what is her Di≈øea≈øe, and given thee ≈øuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as will content them that ≈øent thee, here is for thy Pains, becau≈øe thou ha≈øt put me to it ≈øo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomely, and ≈øo gives her (fearing le≈øt he ≈øhould have erred, that ≈øhe may maintain his Credit, and in hopes of receiving a better Fee for being ≈øent for) the Groat or Six-pence; nay, if it chance to be a Six-pence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63575:73"/>≈øhe ≈øhall have it all, and ≈øo he ≈øhall be ≈øure to have his Me≈ø≈øage well done, and perhaps ≈øhe will tell him that which ≈øhe denyed before, if not, ≈øhe will magnifie him for his Skill, and he ≈øhall be ≈øure to hear further from the Party, and have the ca≈øting of all the Waters ≈øhe can bring him. So now he ≈øends her away, and laughs at her, and the Devil at them both: He laughs at her, becau≈øe he has cozened her, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that he has cozened them both, by making her to believe that he di≈øcerns all tho≈øe things by the Water that he told her, and making him to back his pretended Knowledge with ≈øuch horrid Cheats.</p>
               <p>In the next place I ≈øhall di≈øcover the great Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ≈øuch as ≈øend their Urine unto a Phy≈øician without any In≈øtructions how the Party is affected, and the de≈øperate Hazard that they put their Lives in, who adventure to take Phy≈øick pre≈øcribed only by the Sight of the Urine.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a Me≈ø≈øenger is ≈øent, and has no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Di≈øea≈øe, nor of the Party that is ≈øick; and now the Pi≈øs-prophet mu≈øt ≈øhew his Skill or never. He takes the Water to examine it, and thinks to que≈øtion with the Me≈ø≈øenger, as with the former, how long the Party has been ≈øick, who≈øe Water it is, and to put in ≈øuch other Que≈øtions as may ≈øhew ≈øuch Circum≈øtances as will di≈øcover the Di≈øea≈øe, and guide him in pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing fit Remedies for the ≈øame: But the Me≈ø≈øenger cannot tell who≈øe Water it is, much lo≈øs the Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, the pre≈øent Strength at this Time, or whether the Party be bound or loo≈øe in his Body, with divers other ≈øuch Circum≈øtances, all which are ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary for him to know, as that without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof he cannot ≈øafely pre≈øcribe any Phy≈øick; and yet this Me≈ø≈øenger cannot tell him one Word, for he ≈øays he was not told, but was only hired to bring him the Water, and to bid him ≈øend ≈øomething to help the Party, and all that he can ≈øay is, that ≈øuch a Man's
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63575:73"/>Servant came to him to get him to come, but does not tell him who≈øe Water it was, nor how long the Party had been ≈øick, and now in God's Name, what ≈øhall he do in this Ca≈øe? For it is pre≈øumed that he knows the Di≈øea≈øe by the Water, and all the Circum≈øtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ≈øame, which are requi≈øite to guide him in pre≈øcribing fit Remedies; and this ba≈øe Fellow has pretended as much, and endeavoured to nur≈øe up Folks in this Folly, as much as other Phy≈øicians have done before him, and has given his Judgment of Di≈øea≈øes by the Sight of the Urine, and backt his pretended Knowledge by ≈øuch Fallacies as I have ≈øpoken of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which neither he, nor any Phy≈øician in the World can give any Judgment of a Di≈øea≈øe; nor come to the Knowledge of ≈øuch Circum≈øtances, unle≈øs the Me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tells them, as may guide them in the pre≈øcribing of ≈øafe Medicines every way proper for the Di≈øea≈øe. However it be, ≈øomething mu≈øt be done, tho' at random, and therefore, looking upon the Water, he perceives it to be very gro≈øs, thick, and turbid, in all Places alike, of an inten≈øe, high, dark, red Colour, and from thence he conceives, according to the foppi≈øh Pi≈øs-maxims, and Rules of our great Pi≈øs-progno≈øtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, there is a great Commixture of ≈øuperabundant Humours, which the Sub≈øtance of it, as they ≈øay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gro≈øs, thick, and turbid, ≈øhews, and that Nature is not yet able to concoct the≈øe Humours; for then there would be ≈øome Separation in the Urine, and it would not be in all Places alike, but would have a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in the Bottom, and be tran≈øparent in the upper Part. He conceives al≈øo, that the Patient has a great Fever, for that the Colour ≈øhews, being red and high, and that there is great Danger; for it is of an high dark red Colour, tending to Blackne≈øs: But yet he cannot tell what manner of Fever it is; for he cannot di≈øcern by the Urine, as common People ≈øuppo≈øe the Pa≈ø≈øions, and Affects of the ≈øick Party, that determine
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63575:74"/>the Di≈øea≈øe, and ≈øhould guide him in pre≈øcribing fit Remedies; and therefore he cannot tell whether it be be≈øt to bleed, to purge, or to give a Gli≈øter, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body will bear any of the≈øe, or whether he had be≈øt give an Anodyne, or ≈øome cooling Julep, or ≈øome cordial Antidote, to expel noxious Humours from the vital Parts. Now which of the≈øe Methods he had be≈øt u≈øe he knows not. But however the Matter is not great; for the Patient ventures but his Life, and why ≈øhould not he venture his Skill? He now therefore pronounces the Party to be lick of a ba≈øtard Pleuri≈øie, or a Fever, and that he would hardly recover; further adding, that he ≈øhould have been blooded a Week ago, and that he fear'd it ≈øhould now be too late, yet he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it to be done; for if any thing in the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him, it mu≈øt be that; if that do it, it is but hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nab: But yet however, he mu≈øt put it in Practice; ≈øo now he ha≈øtes away the Me≈ø≈øenger to get a Surgeon, and tells him where, and in what Quantity the Blood mu≈øt be taken away. And now, it is a Que≈øtion whether the Di≈øea≈øe, or the Life be let out by this Blood let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But perhaps, in≈øtead of bleeding he pre≈øcribes ≈øome purging Potion, and ≈øo ≈øets the Di≈øea≈øe and the Medicine together by the Ears, and leaves the Succe≈øs to Fortune, and now whether the Party lives or dyes he cares not; for if he dyes he has taught them to blame their own Negligence in not ≈øending any ≈øooner. But if Nature be of ≈øuch Force, that ≈øhe is able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the Conflicts between the Di≈øea≈øe and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, and ≈øtand up and take part with the Medicine, ≈øo that the Party recover, he ≈øhall receive more Prai≈øe, as being the only Cau≈øe of the Patient's Recovery, than Almighty God, who in his Providence has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, by the Work of Nature, more than by any Skill of his, to ≈øpare and recover him. And thus the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple overvalue the Means, whereby as they ≈øuppo≈øe, they have been recovered, tho' u≈øed ≈øo de≈øperately, as has been de≈øcribed above.</p>

               <p>And now I hope you perceive, by the≈øe few In≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, how a Man may deceive the wi≈øe≈øt Me≈ø≈øenger that you can ≈øend to a Phy≈øician with the Water, and ≈øhew you the Di≈øea≈øe by the ≈øame, altho' it be not there to be found; and how great Danger they put their Lives in, that adventure to take Phy≈øick pre≈øcribed by the Sight of the Urine only; and ≈øo I have done with all acute and violent Di≈øea≈øes, and am now coming to ≈øpeak of chronical, lingring, and Di≈øea≈øes of Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, wherein I mean to ≈øhew how the≈øe Pi≈øs-prophets give Judgment of them by the Water, tho' in the≈øe Di≈øea≈øes it ≈øhews le≈øs than in acute and violent Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes.

               <p>Now I come to ≈øhew how they come to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whether it be a chronical Di≈øea≈øes or no, tho' the Urine ≈øhew no ≈øuch thing, namely, by the ≈øame Que≈øtion that was propounded in giving Judgment upon Urines in acute and violent Di≈øea≈øes; and the Que≈øtion was this, the Pi≈øs-monger asks the Me≈ø≈øenger how long the Party has been ≈øick; by An≈øwer whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he is certified whether the Di≈øea≈øe be chronical or violent, for if the Pi≈øs po≈øt ≈øays a Week or le≈øs, then he pre≈øumes it is a violent Di≈øea≈øe: But if he ≈øay that the Party has not been very well a good while, which is commonly their An≈øwer in chronical Di≈øea≈øes, he is confirmed the Di≈øea≈øe is chronical, and when he has once received this An≈øwer to the forenamed Que≈øtion, let the Water be what Colour ≈øoever it will, he knows how to give an An≈øwer that ≈øhall plea≈øe the Me≈ø≈øenger, and will find the Di≈øea≈øe.</p>
               <p>A≈ø≈øoon as the Pi≈øs-prophet hears a knocking at his his Door, he trudges in Ha≈øte to ≈øee what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and looking ≈øharp, as if he had greater Bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs than to examine a Pi≈øs-pot, he finds there three or four Pi≈øs-Me≈ø≈øengers at once with their Urinals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Aprons, whom he u≈øhers into the Hall, and looks very ≈øternly upon them, and asks them very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtily (to the end he might da≈øh them ≈øo far out of Countenance, that they may not be capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whether he err or no in giving Judgment on their Waters; and to make them the more ready to tell him what≈øoever he ≈øhall demand of them) what they would have with him, where they live, who≈øe Water it is that they bring, and the like, and they are all ready to pre≈øent their Waters, looking who ≈øhall be di≈øpatched fir≈øt: But before he takes any of their Urinals, he ≈øounds them, to know how far he ≈øhall be puzzled with them, di≈øpatching tho≈øe fir≈øt, that he finds he ≈øhall be lea≈øt troubled with. To the fir≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ≈øays, where live you? And ≈øhe an≈øwers, in ≈øuch
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63575:75"/>a Place, naming it. He further asks her who≈øe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, he asks her al≈øo who is her Mi≈øtre≈øs; to which ≈øhe an≈øwers very orderly, and is now ready to put forth her Urinal unto him; but he does not take it, nor does he ask her any more Que≈øtions, for ≈øhe will be ready to tell him what≈øoever he ≈øhall demand; he comes therefore to the ≈øecond, and asks her where ≈øhe dwells, and ≈øhe having told him, he likewi≈øe asks her who≈øe Water it is that ≈øhe has brought, and ≈øhe ≈øays, a Gentlewoman's, who de≈øired her to bring it unto him, and ≈øhe is ready to give it him; but he refu≈øes it: He goes now to the third, and asks her where ≈øhe dwells, and that ≈øhe is contented to tell him; but when he asks who≈øe Water it is, ≈øhe pau≈øes here, and makes a Doubt whether ≈øhe had be≈øt tell him or not, therefore an≈øwers, that it is her Friend's; then he asks her what Friend it is, and whether it be a Man's or a Woman's Water, and ≈øhe tells him that he ≈øhould perceive that by the Water when he looks upon it, and holds forth her Urinal, in Hope that he will di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch her fir≈øt; but he refu≈øes to take it, for he is like to be more puzzled with her, and it will require more Time and Art to an≈øwer her than both the other, and therefore ≈øhe ≈øhall tarry to be the la≈øt an≈øwered for that Trick; he now therefore takes the Urinal of her that told him it was her Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes Water, and ≈øingles her out from her Fellows, bids her follow him into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Room; for he mu≈øt not let ≈øeveral Me≈ø≈øengers hear what he ≈øays to each other; becau≈øe he may chance to ≈øtop two Gaps with one Bu≈øh, and to give the ≈øame An≈øwer and De≈øcription of the Di≈øea≈øe; and indeed one De≈øcription will as well ≈øerve for all chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Di≈øea≈øes, as a De≈øcription of a Fever for all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Di≈øea≈øes; he having therefore took the Maid into another Room, bids her come to the Light, and as he is taking the Urinal out of the Ca≈øe, perceiving it to be of a ≈øubcitrine, or pale Colour, which ≈øeems not to

In the mean Time he falls to parly with the Maid, and asks her whether her Mi≈øtre≈øs has had any Child or no, and how long, if ≈øhe has, it is ≈øince ≈øhe had one, and ≈øhe ≈øays, a Year, a Year and an Half, or almo≈øt two Years, and indeed mo≈øt child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women go a Year, or near upon, and many a Year and Half, and ≈øome two Years, before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with Child again, e≈øpecially if they nur≈øe their Children them≈øelves.

So now, if it chance to be a Boy indeed, it will be granted that he knew for certain that it would be a Boy, and he ≈øhall be accounted one of the rare≈øt Doctors in the Town; but if it chance to be a Girl, the Flam that he gave the Maid, and the Truth of his Predictions in determining the Gentlewoman to be with Child, and telling her how long ≈øhe was gone with Child will help to bear up the other; ≈øo that be ≈øhall not have his Shill one jot abated thereby. He now therefore tells the Maid, as if ≈øhe were but ju≈øt come in, that her Mi≈øtre≈øs is not very well in her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, has no Appetite to her Meat, is inclined to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit after her Meat, and is a quarter gone with Child, and he thinks of a Boy, and that it is very convenient for her to take ≈øome corroborating Electuary to ≈øtrengthen and ≈øettle her Stomach, tho' ≈øhe be with Child; nay, he ≈øays, that it would be good, not only for her ≈øelf, but for her Child al≈øo; and he bids her tell her Mi≈øtre≈øs that it will make her Child pro≈øper the better within her, and make it the more lively, ≈øo that it will help it ≈øelf, and make her Delivery the more ea≈øie, and will al≈øo make the Child wi≈øe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63575:77"/>and a Feeling for his Apothecary; for what Woman would not have her Child pro≈øper within her, and be ea≈øily delivered of a wi≈øe Child? He therefore, upon the ≈øecond Application, pre≈øcribes an Electuary of Marmalade, or ≈øome other Confection of Quinces, with ≈øome Species or Con≈øerves to di≈øgui≈øe it, tho' Marmalade alone would have done as well, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed proper to ≈øtop vomiting, and ≈øtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; but whether it will make a wi≈øe Child I know not.</p>
               <p>Having di≈øpatched this Maid, he calls in the ≈øecond Me≈ø≈øenger, and ≈øays to her, come good Woman, give give me thy Urinal, and tells her (the Urine being of ≈øuch a Colour as imports not an acute Di≈øea≈øe, that is, of a high red Colour) that this Gentlewoman walks up and down, has a crude Stomach, no Appetite to Meat, and is, if ≈øhe feed liberally, ill after it; and by rea≈øon of the ill Di≈øpo≈øition of her Stomach, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pained in the Head; and here the Woman ≈øtops him before he run any further (for otherwi≈øe he may chance to reckon up mo≈øt of the Symptoms that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company chronical Di≈øea≈øes, till he hit upon that which the Me≈ø≈øenger lookt for) and ≈øays, ≈øhe is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a great Pain in the Head indeed, but does not much complain of her Stomach; and then he replies, that the Pain of the Head proceeds from the Stomach, and that the Stomach is always acce≈ø≈øary to the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes of the Head, and that he named the Illne≈øs of her Stomach fir≈øt, becau≈øe it was the Cau≈øe of her Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, and having once given a De≈øcription of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, he will be ≈øure to make it good, whether it be true or fal≈øe; for if he had ≈øaid that ≈øhe had been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with an Ob≈øtruction of the Liver, and Pain in the Head, the Me≈ø≈øenger ≈øhould ≈øay, no Ma≈øter Doctor, ≈øhe is troubled with an Illne≈øs and Pain in the Stomach, he will ≈øay it is very true indeed, and I ≈øhould have told you ≈øo, had you not interrupted me, for it comes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63575:77"/>from the Head; for the Stomach and Head do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offend each other, and what can ≈øhe ≈øay to the contrary? And if, when he has given a De≈øcription of the Di≈øea≈øe, ≈øhe ≈øays, Sir, ≈øhe is much as you have ≈øaid; but do you not perceive ≈øhe has a very weak Back? to which he an≈øwer, yes marry has ≈øhe, and ≈øomething el≈øe too, which I ≈øhall tell you pre≈øently: And then he takes the Urine and looks upon it, and ≈øhakes it together, and ≈øets it down in the Window to ≈øettle, pretending it will ≈øhew him ≈øomething el≈øe anon; in the mean Time he gathers, by Conference with the Me≈ø≈øenger, whether it be a married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's or a Maiden's Water, and then he takes the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ≈øays, if it be a married Woman's, that ≈øhe has a very weak Back indeed, and that ≈øhe is troubled with the Whites, which is a Di≈øea≈øe that very many Women are troubled with that complain of weak Backs. But if the Water chance to be a Maiden Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman's Water, who is either troubled with a Pain or Heat in her Back, and the Me≈ø≈øenger asking if ≈øhe be not troubled with one of them, he pre≈øently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures them both in the Water.</p>
               <p>But as to the Gentlewoman that is married, he ≈øays, that ≈øhe has a very weak Back, is troubled with the Whites, and that this Di≈øea≈øe has hindred her being with Child; for the Me≈ø≈øenger has told him before, that the Gentlewoman has not had a Child within three or four Years, and that ≈øhe will have no more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unle≈øs ≈øhe were freed of them; and now he mu≈øt think upon ≈øomething to cure this Gentlewoman, for he is ≈øure ≈øhe will ≈øend to him again to help her to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Child: And now he is ready for the third Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenger, that ≈øaid, ≈øhe came from a Friend of hers. He has made this Go≈ø≈øip tarry till the la≈øt; becau≈øe he was afraid ≈øhe would prove a cro≈øs Piece of Fle≈øh to deal with; and therefore he handles her gently; for the wilde≈øt Colts are often tamed by gentle Means.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63575:78"/>He ≈øays, Mi≈øtre≈øs, I have made you tarry, but you ≈øhall not altogether lo≈øe your Labour, I pray you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and ≈øo be conducts her into his Parlour, where his Man is waiting for him, with a Tankard of Ale and a To≈øt with Nutmeg and Sugar for his Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings Draught; then he ≈øits down in his Chair, and ≈øays, here good Woman, I drink to you, and then bids her drink a hearty Draught; then he bids her mend her Draught, and tells her, that Nutmeg and Sugar in Beer in a Morning will make her Water ≈øweet, and thus are the perver≈øe Di≈øpo≈øitions of cro≈øs Me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers better corrected, than the Malignity of Scamony with Ani≈ø-Seeds, or Rhubarb with Spike; be≈øides, he having drunk his Mornings Draught, which will much enable him to ≈øee clear, he now ≈øays, come good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, how long has your Friend been ≈øick? ≈øhe ≈øays, he hath not been very well a good while, and ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers him the Urinal: But he refu≈øes to take it, and ≈øays, becau≈øe I have made you ≈øtay ≈øo long, I will ≈øhew your Friend's Di≈øea≈øe by the Urinal Ca≈øe, and never look upon the Water at all, and yet I will tell you the Di≈øea≈øe as well as he that ≈øhall pore and peep into the Water a Month. He now therefore takes the Urinal Ca≈øe of her, and looks as wi≈øtly upon it as if it were the Urinal, and the Water in it, and pre≈øently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces that the Party goes up and down, is not Heart ≈øick, but is faint in the Body, has a bad Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, lingers and pines as it were, is joyle≈øs and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and takes no Plea≈øure in any thing; and now the Woman wonders to hear him ≈øay ≈øo, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only upon the Urinal Ca≈øe, and yet what he ≈øays is as true as if he had lookt in the Urine. And thus the Me≈ø≈øenger is ≈øoon caught, for he askt her before he took the Urinal Ca≈øe of her, how long her Friend had been ≈øick, and ≈øhe told him that he had not been very well a good while; from which An≈øwer I ≈øhall ≈øhew both the Sex and the Di≈øea≈øe; for this Word, he, ≈øhews

The latter Part of her An≈øwer, <hi>viz.</hi> A good while, ≈øhews that it is a Chronical Di≈øea≈øe, and the former Part of the Words, namely, hath not been very well, does imply, lyes not by it; and that therefore he goes up and down; he has no Appetite to Meat, is faint in his Body, lingers and pines as it were, is joyle≈øs and melancholy, and takes no Plea≈øure in any thing, as he told her before, and ≈øo are all they that have not been very well for a good while. But the Woman never dreams that he gathers all this from her An≈øwer; becau≈øe he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Urinal Ca≈øe; but thinks rather that the Urinal infected the Ca≈øe, or el≈øe that he can conjure. But he will make her wonder more anon; and now he adds, that it is a Man's Water, to which ≈øhe an≈øwers, it is indeed. He further asks her how old the Party is, and according to her An≈øwer, as the Parties Age ≈øhall agree with hers, he ≈øays that it is her Husband's Water, at which ≈øhe marvels more than at all the re≈øt, and ≈øays, it is indeed. And now ≈øhe is ready to put Finger in Eye, and asks him if he be not in a Con≈øumption, and tells him, for he did not name it, that he has a very great Cough, and asks him if he did not perceive it, then he tells her, that this Cough proceeds from an ill Stomach, which he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>A Gli≈øter is of good U≈øe in Phy≈øick, and it ≈øerves to mollifie the Excrements, to di≈øcu≈øs Wind, and to clean≈øe the Bowels from vi≈øcid Humours, tho' their Vertue, as mo≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe, reaches no farther than the Guts, yet a Woman has been di≈øordered in her Head by a Gli≈øter of Wine injected. Some ≈øay, that Opium in Gli≈øters procures Sleep, and <hi>Sennertus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øes, in his Chapter of a Frenzy, when the Patient is very weak, to mix Opiates with Gli≈øters. The Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Gli≈øter is commonly pre≈øcribed to fifteen or eighteen Ounces, which is often too much, when the Guts are filled with Excrements or Wind, or when the Patient is ≈øhort of Stature.</p>
               <p>Gli≈øters, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> may be ≈øub≈øtituted for purging Medicines. When Purges do not their Office,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63575:79"/>Phy≈øicians commonly inject a Gli≈øter; but ≈øome think that a Suppo≈øitory made of Honey and half a Dram of Salt is better in this Ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>Gli≈øters made of Oyl of ≈øweet Almonds are counted very effectual in the Cholick. A Gli≈øter of Tabacco is very proper to empty the Bowels. Let two Pipes be filled with Tabacco after the u≈øual Manner, then light them, and turn the Mouths of their Heads one upon the other, then put the ≈ømaller End of one up the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, and holding the ≈ømall End of the other in your Mouth, you may blow the Smoak up into the Guts.</p>
               <p>A Vomit works by moving inordinately the Fibres of the Nerves of the Stomach. A Vomit does not only evacuate from the Stomach, but al≈øo from the ≈ømall Guts, the <hi>Ductus Cholidochus,</hi> and from the pancreatic Duct. But all do not equally bear Vomits; tho≈øe who are narrow brea≈øted, that are ≈øubject to an A≈øthma, ≈øpitting of Blood, vomit with great Danger: But they are of excellent U≈øe when the Appetite is languid, and when the Stomach nau≈øeates and when the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Cau≈øe lurks in the Stomach; nor is vomiting ≈øo very dangerous a Remedy, as is commonly thought; for Rea≈øon and daily Experience ≈øhews the contrary. But frequent and difficult vomiting loo≈øens the Tone of the Stomach, weakens the Bowels, and hurts the Head.</p>
               <p>No purging Medicine purges electively, or is de≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for evacuating ≈øome particular Humour, but works upon all the Humours, and therefore it is vain to think that Cholagogs purge only Choler, Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogs only Flegm, Melanagogs only Melancholy, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogs only Water. It is al≈øo vain to think that a Purge is appropriated to the Head only, or to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Spleen only, or the like; for every Purge circulates with the Blood, and is carried to every Part, and works upon it.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:63575:80"/>
               <p>Purging is proper for a Cacochymy, to carry off the ill Humous. The Strength ought to be good, which may be known by the Pul≈øe; the Age, the Sex, the Temperament, the Habit of Body, the Cu≈øtom, and the like; the middle Age bears purging be≈øt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and Old Age are purged difficulty. If Children are to be purged, the Cathartic mu≈øt be given to the Nur≈øe, for ≈øo it is ≈øuckt in with the Milk, and works more kindly. Men bear purging better than Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But ≈øome Women, e≈øpecially ≈øuch as have a Stoppage of their Cour≈øes, bear ≈øtrong Purges. In the purging of Women you mu≈øt take notice, that they mu≈øt not be purged when they have their Cour≈øes upon them, and big bellied Women are not to be purged ra≈øhly; for there is Danger of Abortion. The ≈øafe≈øt Time of purging them is from the fourth Month to the ≈øeventh; but now a-days big bellied Women are purged at any Time with gentle Purges.</p>
               <p>An hot and moi≈øt Temperament, and a fle≈øhy Habit of Body bear Purges be≈øt.</p>
               <p>We mu≈øt take notice in pre≈øcribing a Purge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body be much bound, and if ≈øo, it is be≈øt to give a Gli≈øter fir≈øt.</p>
               <p>Some ≈øay that the Humours mu≈øt not be purged till they are concocted or prepared by previous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: But our modern Practice is contrary to this. The Do≈øe of a purging Medicine is to be found out by Experience, for the Propriety and Condition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are various; we mu≈øt therefore ask the Patient whether he has taken a Purge at any Time when he was ≈øick, and whether it wrought enough, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to De≈øire or not; if you under≈øtand that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is ea≈øie to work upon, then u≈øe the more gentle means, or a ≈ømaller Do≈øe.</p>

               <p>Bleeding is a very ancient Remedy, u≈øed by all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and there are few Di≈øea≈øes wherein it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, if the Strength be ≈øufficient; but e≈øpecially when the Quantity of it is too great, or when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trava≈øated upon ≈øome Part, or coagulated. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63575:81"/>were wont to reckon three Sorts of bleeding, one for Evacuation, another for Revul≈øion, and the third for Derivation: But I admit but of one, and that is of Evacuation, and that does all; for when Part of it is evacuated, the re≈øt is better contained in the Ve≈ø≈øels, and circulates better, ≈øo that Fluxion is prevented, and an Inflammation, and the Veins being emptied, that Blood which is extrava≈øated is the ea≈øier recalled, as in a Quin≈øy, Peripneumonia, Pleuri≈øy, and other Inflammations.</p>
               <p>Some reckon there is a great Difference about the Veins that are to be opened; for they think that ≈øome above others do evacuate a certain Part, and therefore they have called ≈øome Veins Cephalic, ≈øome Hepatic, ≈øome I≈øchiadiac, and the like: But one would think the≈øe neither under≈øtand Anatomy nor Circulation; for otherwi≈øe they would know that the Veins communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Arteries, and like ≈øo many Rivulets, take their Ri≈øe from the ≈øame Fountain; and therefore it is no matter of which ≈øide the Vein is opened, or which it is, only that which is large≈øt and the mo≈øt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou≈øly opened is to be cho≈øen: But in an Ob≈øtruction of the Cour≈øes, a Vein of the Foot mu≈øt be opened; becau≈øe thereby the Flux of them is promoted, and ≈øuch Ob≈øtructions are often turned this way.</p>
               <p>The Veins which are wont to be opened in the Head are the Jugular, the Temporal, the Vein of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and that under the Tongue; in the Arm, the Cephalic, Middle, and Ba≈øilic; in the Hand, the Salvatella and Cephalic; in the Foot, the I≈øchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac.</p>
               <p>In opening the≈øe Veins, Care mu≈øt be taken that the Nerve or Tendon lying under be not hurt, le≈øt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul≈øions, and other grievous Accidents, or Death ≈øhould follow. Care ≈øhould be al≈øo taken that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery lying under be not hurt, for ≈øo an Aneuri≈øm will be occa≈øioned, and in clo≈øing the Wound you mu≈øt not

Care mu≈øt be al≈øo taken that a Vein be not opened ra≈øhly in the Plague, Small-pox, Petechial, and Malignant Fevers, le≈øt the Malignity ≈øhould ≈øtrike in and kill the Patient, nor in the State of Fevers, nor in the cold Fit of Agues, nor in great bellied Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, e≈øpecially at the Beginning or End of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child. Moreover, Women with Child mu≈øt not be blooded in the Foot, in the Arm there is le≈øs Danger; and now many Women are wont to bleed when they are with Child, thinking that it is good for the Child's Health, and indeed it often ≈øucceeds very well.</p>
               <p>Too much Blood mu≈øt not be taken away at a time. You never ought to take away above a Pound at one time, nor ≈øo much but in extraordinary Ca≈øes. The common Quantities are ≈øeven, eight, nine or ten Ounces, and it is better to repeat bleeding, than to take away too much at a time.</p>
               <p>You ought not to bleed till the Blood turns to a better Colour, as the Cu≈øtom of ≈øome is; for ≈øometimes that which come out fir≈øt is red, and that which follows is of another Colour, and if you would continue bleeding till the Colour change better, the Patient's Life will be endangered; and you ought never to bleed till the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient faints, as is the Cu≈øtom of ≈øome. It is be≈øt to receive the Blood in Porringers, that the exact Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it may be known.</p>
               <p>Old Men and Children do not bear bleeding well, yet ≈øometimes they mu≈øt be blooded in a Quin≈øey, Pleuri≈øie, or the like.</p>
               <p>More Blood may be taken away from fle≈øhy People than from fat; al≈øo from ≈øuch as are thin, if they have not been rendred ≈øo by a ≈øpare Diet and much Labour, for ≈øuch have mo≈øt Blood.</p>

               <p>Some Phy≈øicians give a Gli≈øter before bleeding, but it is not nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
               <p>Many will not bleed in the Dog-days, as if there were ≈øomething ≈øpecial then that oppo≈øed it: But the Heat of that Time, and the Di≈ø≈øipation of the Strength thereby are the only things to be minded, for if the Weather be then temperate, or if Nece≈ø≈øity urge, you may bleed.</p>
               <p>The Jugular Veins may be ≈øafely opened notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the Prejudice of the common People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Veins are large, and there is neither Nerve nor Artery under them.</p>
               <p>It is thought proper to ≈øleep an Hour or two after bleeding, to recover the Strength, tho' it has been formerly reckoned hazardous.</p>
               <p>It is certain that bleeding is profitable again≈øt a Plethora, whether already compleat, or but a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for the Mi≈øchiefs of a Plethora cannot be better taken awak or prevented by any other Remedy; yet we ≈øhould avoid this Evacuation as much as we may, becau≈øe the Blood thereby becomes more ≈øulphureous, and le≈øs ≈øalt, and therefore almo≈øt all Per≈øons are apt thereupon to fall into Fevers, and to grow fat. Moreover, bleeding being a great Remedy, if it be pro≈øtituted to every little Occa≈øion, it will become le≈øs profitable when there is need to u≈øe it for great Di≈øea≈øes, to which this may be added, that according to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Ob≈øervation, the more familiarly any one u≈øes bleeding, the oftner he ≈øhall need it, becau≈øe Blood being often let to avoid a Plethora, the re≈øt of the Ma≈øs will the ≈øooner ri≈øe again to a Plethora, far otherwi≈øe than ≈øome think, who fear le≈øt the Store of the Blood ≈øhould be wa≈øted by bleeding, ≈øeeing on the contrary by this means its Quantity becomes larger, tho its Cra≈øis be wor≈øe; for thus the Blood being ≈øpoiled of its bal≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic Salt, and of its Salt that pre≈øerves it from Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is in≈øtead thereof ≈øaturated with a fatening Sulphur.</p>

                  <hi>Galen</hi> ≈øays, that Old Age does not forbid bleeding; you ≈øhall open a Vein in Men of ≈øeventy, ≈øays he, if the Di≈øea≈øe require it; for there are ≈øome even of this Age that have much Blood, and are brisk, wherefore you ought not only to have regard to the Number of Years, which ≈øome do, but al≈øo to the Habit of the Body, for there are ≈øome that cannot endure bleeding at ≈øixty, whereas there are others that can bear it at ≈øeventy; however le≈øs Blood mu≈øt be taken from the≈øe than from young People. If therefore a brisk old Man be afflicted with a Pleuri≈øie, Peripneumony, a burning Fever, or the like, there is no doubt but he may and ought to be let blood, ≈øeeing without that Remedy, ≈øuch Di≈øea≈øes can hardly ever be cured, and if they are not able to endure the Remedy, they mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily peri≈øh. An old Man of ≈øeventy three Years of Age has been let blood ≈øour times in three Days, and lo≈øt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ounces of Blood; and tho' the Ancients thought Infancy and Old Age could not bear this kind of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet it matters not what the Age is, but what the Strength is; therefore if a young Man be weak, it is bad to let him blood, but a lu≈øty Boy, and a hearty brisk old Man do ≈øafely admit of bleeding; a Child ≈øeven Weeks old was taken with a cruel Pleuri≈øy, the Signs whereof were a violent Cough, an acute Fever, and when he was laid down in his Cradle, or held in Arms, if he were touched never ≈øo lightly on the right Side, after having coughed a little, he would cry very vehemently, with Difficulty of breathing; in this ca≈øe two Leeches were applyed to the bending of the right Arm, and two Ounces of Blood were taken away, which Remedy was of that Efficacy, that the Child was quite cured the ≈øame Day of this dangerous Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe.</p>
               <p>An Idio≈øyncra≈øy, or the ≈øingular Property of each ones Nature, makes ≈øome to endure any bleeding well, and others neither that which is large nor indifferent;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63575:83"/>yea, ≈øome are afraid and di≈øcouraged at the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of it, and ≈øwoon as ≈øoon as they are pricked.</p>
               <p>He that would determine the Quantity of Blood that is to be let, ought to con≈øider the Country, the Strength and Plenitude of the Body. In hot Countries that are near to the Meridian, large bleeding is not ≈øo well born as in the middle Climates. The <hi>French,</hi> e≈øpecially in <hi>Paris,</hi> bleed very largely; but colder Countries that are nearer the North, ≈øeem not to bear ≈øuch large Evacuations of the Blood ≈øo well, whether the Fevers be acute, continual, or intermittent.</p>
               <p>Letting of blood may breed a Cu≈øtom; thus the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> who u≈øe often to ≈øcari≈øie their Foreheads, their Forehead itches, and Blood is redundant; as likewi≈øe does the Shoulder Blade and Arm in tho≈øe who have been u≈øed to be ≈øcarified or bleed in tho≈øe Parts; for the emptied Part draws from the whole, and Nature endeavours to unburthen her ≈øelf by that Part which u≈øes to be opened.</p>
               <p>If in the Middle of a Di≈øea≈øe, or at the Beginning, Blood begins to flow out of the Womb, Phy≈øicians lay ≈øo great Stre≈øs upon the Benefit of that Region, that tho' it ≈ølows out at an u≈øual Time, meerly ≈øymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, they dare not u≈øe any other Evacuation which may ≈øtay that Fluxion, whence it comes to pa≈øs, that in the Cure of acute Di≈øea≈øes, they often incur great Danger by ≈øuch Scruple, as when in the Beginning of a Pleuri≈øie, or Peripneumony, or burning Fever, the Terms begin to flow, there are few who do not let ≈ølip the Opportunity of letting blood, or if in any acute Di≈øea≈øe they dare do it, they do it in the Foot, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as I ≈øuppo≈øe, by the Benefits of that Region, and being affrighted by the Dangers that are wont to happen, upon the Suppre≈ø≈øion of the Terms; but it does not become Arti≈øts to receive any Matter ≈øo indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinctly: That Evacuation of Blood by the Womb which is natural, is indeed profitable unto Women up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63575:83"/>many Accounts, and is generally ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed with great Prejudice; yet that Evacuation is not always made with a like Benefit; and therefore it is neither ≈øtopt always with the ≈øame Danger; but the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens commonly in this, as in other Evacuations; we mu≈øt therefore con≈øider not only from whence the Blood flows, but whether it flows ≈øea≈øonably, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at that time, when there may be made a <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> of the Di≈øea≈øe, and when the Terms u≈øe to flow, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at neither of the≈øe times, but while the Di≈øea≈øe is yet crude, and the Month is not yet quite come about, or whether it be come about, but the Di≈øea≈øe is not ripe for a <hi>Cri≈øis,</hi> or whether it be ripe for a <hi>Cri≈øis,</hi> but the Month is not yet come about; for if the fir≈øt happens, you may e≈øteem the Evacuation to be very ≈øea≈øonable, and that the men≈øtrual Evacuation of the Body, and the Solution of the Di≈øea≈øe have happily jumpt upon the ≈øame time; you ≈øhall therefore give way to ≈øuch an Evacuation, if it be made entirely, if not, you mu≈øt help it by all means; therefore you ≈øhall open no Vein, or if you do, it mu≈øt be in the Leg. But if the Evacuation be ≈øea≈øonable upon neither Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then matter it not, but let blood where, and as much as the Di≈øea≈øe requires, abating only ≈øo much of the Quantity as you think may be ≈øupplied by the Fluxion that ca≈øually happens; therefore if it be a Pleuri≈øie, let blood in the Arm, not mattering tho' it flow out of the Womb, if the Evacuation come before the u≈øual Day of the Month, and yet happen fitly for a <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> of the Di≈øea≈øe, the Rule of a ≈øea≈øonable <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> ≈øhall be ob≈øerved to let it alone if the Flux be large enough, if not you mu≈øt help it; but you mu≈øt not hinder or divert it upon any Account, nor mu≈øt you attempt another Evacuation, and if it be un≈øea≈øonable for the Di≈øea≈øe, but comes at a due Time of the Month, if ≈øo be the Di≈øea≈øe be indifferent to upper or lower Evacuations, as ≈øuppo≈øe the Stone in the Kidnies, or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63575:84"/>be without a certain Seat, as a Fever, Blood ≈øhall be let out of the Leg, if there be need to let it: But if the Di≈øea≈øe require Evacuation by the upper Parts, and be urgent, the Phy≈øician may bleed alternately above and below.</p>
               <p>Bleeding by a large Orifice helps more than bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a ≈øtraight, when the Quantity of the Blood that is let is equal, becau≈øe it has made a more ≈øudden Change in the Body, when the Blood is poured out by a large Hole.</p>
               <p>Some e≈øteem ≈øo much the fir≈øt time one is let blood, that they will not u≈øe it but in great Ca≈øes; becau≈øe they think, that like an unu≈øual and fir≈øt Remedy, it may cure a Man of great Di≈øea≈øes, and this vulgar Opinion ≈øeems to be ju≈øtified by what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes of the fir≈øt Eruption of the Terms, and the fir≈øt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation; and <hi>Cel≈øus</hi> ≈øays, if any Kind of Di≈øea≈øe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in Infancy, and ends neither when a Man comes to Maturity, nor upon the fir≈øt Coition, nor in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man upon the fir≈øt flowing of her Terms, the ≈øame is generally of long Continuance.</p>
               <p>It is di≈øcu≈ø≈øed by ≈øome later Phy≈øicians, how long we mu≈øt ab≈øtain from Meat after bleeding. <hi>Galen,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having bled a young Man ≈øick of a Synochus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Putrefaction, gave ≈øome Food two Hours after. Others have ≈øaid that we may allow Victuals one Hour or two after bleeding, tho not much: But this is a thing for the Phy≈øician to gue≈øs at, according to the Quantity of Blood that is let, and the Strength of the Patient's Faculties; for <hi>Galen</hi> ≈øtayed two Hours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he let blood very plentifully, whereby his Strength and Spirits were weakened, ≈øo that he fainted away. But we that bleed far more ≈øparingly, and do not ≈øo much dimini≈øh the Heat, Spirits, and Strength, have no rea≈øon to tarry ≈øo long.</p>
               <p>In the Di≈øea≈øes of Children, and of Women with Child, the Phy≈øician con≈øults well for him≈øelf, and his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63575:84"/>Patients, if he be pre≈øent when they are to be bled; for tho≈øe who are intru≈øted with that Operation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too bold, do ≈øuffer the Blood to i≈ø≈øue out too large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if any unfortunate thing happen, it is pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a≈øcribed to the Phy≈øician.</p>
               <p>When a Fillet is tyed about any Member, and the Vein that u≈øes to be found in that Part does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but ≈øomething that is round is felt deep under the Skin, of which you doubt whether it be a Vein or not, pre≈øently loo≈øen the Fillet, if it be a Vein, it al≈øo growing lax, will fall down, and be no longer percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by your Finger till you bind the Member again: but if, when the Fillet is loo≈øened, that which you touched feels as it did before it was tyed, then u≈øe not your Lancet, for it is not a Vein but a Tendon, or the Head of a Mu≈øcle, or ≈øomething be≈øide a Vein, and the Arteries beat where they are, whereby both their Situation and Depth become manife≈øt, even to a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experienced Arti≈øt.</p>
               <p>If when you have occa≈øion to bleed, the Vein do not appear, a large Cupping-gla≈øs, with much Flame is to be fixed upon the Part, and that will make the Vein ≈øhew it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>In bleeding there often happens a ≈øwooning or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, which u≈øes to cau≈øe greater Fear in tho≈øe who are pre≈øent, yea, in Phy≈øicians that are young Practitioners, than Harm to the Patient: This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not thro' the Fault of the Arti≈øt, but the Softne≈øs of the Patient's Mind, which too readily di≈øturbs the Spirits; but this may be ea≈øily prevented, if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lye along, and hold ≈øome Water or Wine in his Mouth whil≈øt the Vein is cut and the Blood flows out; if he faint notwith≈øtanding, ≈øtop the Blood by laying your Thumb upon the Orifice, and ≈øprinkle his Face pre≈øently with cold Water. If the fainting continue, pinch his No≈øe al≈øo, and when the fainting is over, taking off your Thumb, let as much Blood be taken
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63575:85"/>as ≈øeems good to the prudent Arti≈øt, and cea≈øe not to bleed as the over-fearful u≈øe often to do.</p>
               <p>We u≈øe Leeches where Bleeding and Cupping-gla≈ø≈øes cannot be applied, as to the No≈øe, Lips, Fingers, and Toes, Womb, Anus, and the like; al≈øo to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and others from whom but a little Blood ought to be taken.</p>
               <p>The be≈øt Leeches are in clear Water, of moderate Bigne≈øs, and of a liver Colour, the Belly reddi≈øh, the Back greeni≈øh with golden Streaks; the re≈øt are venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, e≈øpecially tho≈øe that are brown, thick-headed, and that live in impure Waters. The≈øe little Animals have little ≈øharp Teeth, whereby they bite and ≈øtick to the Skin of Men and other Animals. That they may ≈øuck the greedier, anoint the Part with a Drop of Pigeons Blood, or of the Blood of a Chick, or rob the Part gently, or prick it a little, and hold them with a Rag, and not with the naked Hand. When they ≈øtick, if you de≈øign to bleed freely, you mu≈øt cut off their Tails, for ≈øo the Blood will drop from them; you mu≈øt take care that none of their Teeth remain in the Part, for ≈øo the VVound is made incurable, and Death often follows; it is therefore better to let them ≈øuck till they are ≈øatiated, and till they fall off of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, or you may ≈øprinkle Salt upon their Heads to ha≈øten their falling off, and in≈øtead of them you may apply others to evacuate a ≈øufficient Quantity of Blood.</p>
               <p>Our Surgeons and Apothecaries provide Yearly a great Stock of them, and keep them in Gla≈ø≈øes, ca≈øting in a little Sugar ≈øometimes to nouri≈øh them. But it may be doubted whether they are made better by this means, perhaps they become more virulent, and wor≈øe hereby. It is fal≈øe, that being applied to the Anus, they ≈øuck away melancholy Blood from the external or internal hemorrhoidal Veins; for fir≈øt, that Vein has not more melancholy Blood in it than any other,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63575:85"/>neither do they carry it from the Spleen, as the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents thought; yea, the Spleen is not the Receptacle of Melancholy, as the Ancients thought.</p>
               <p>If Leeches are to be applied to the hemorrhoidal Veins, fir≈øt let the Fundament be fomented with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Mallows, or the like.</p>
               <p>Cupping-gla≈ø≈øes are made of Gla≈øs or Horn, or the like; they are to be applied to carnous Parts, and ≈øtick clo≈øe to them: They mu≈øt not be applied upon Tendons or Arteries. They are to be applied after the Part is well rubbed with a linnen Rag. Tho≈øe that work without Fire are either made of Horn or Wood, and a Hole is in the End of them, through which the Air is drawn, when they are placed upon the Part. Tho≈øe which are applied with Fire have a little Flax in them, which is to be fired ju≈øt as they are about to be put on: But le≈øt the Flax ≈øhould burn the Fle≈øh, it is fa≈øtened to the Bottom of the Cupping-gla≈øs with a little Wax or Turpentine. Tho≈øe which are without Scarification draw out only the Blood and Humours from the neighbouring Parts, ≈øo as that they may the better tran≈øpire through the Skin: But ≈øuch as are applied with Scarification ≈øen≈øibly evacuate many Ounces of Blood and Humours, and much more if a Cupping-gla≈øs be applied before the Scarification. The U≈øe of Cupping-gla≈ø≈øes is very effectual in many Ca≈øes, e≈øpecially to draw out any malignant thing from the Body: But they are more painful than bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Frictions are made with hot Cloaths, with and without Pain, and till the Skin is red. The Ancients u≈øed them for Revul≈øion, ≈øuppo≈øing that ≈øo the Blood and other Humours about to flow to the Head might be drawn to another Part, ≈øuppo≈øe the Back or Arm; but Frictions do not operate ≈øo powerfully in this Ca≈øe, as to hinder the Flux of any Humour to the Head, or if they do any ≈øuch thing, it is of ≈øo little Duration
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63575:86"/>and Efficacy that it does not de≈øerve the Name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul≈øion; therefore I think Frictions ≈øerve chiefly to make the Blood flow more plentifully to the Skin, and to carry off any ill thing mixed with it through the Pores of the Skin: They al≈øo ea≈øe ≈ømall Pains of the Head, and a≈ø≈øwage an Epileptic Fit; ≈øuch as are ≈øtrong and painful are proper for ≈øleepy Di≈øea≈øes.</p>
               <p>Frictions are al≈øo very proper for old Men; they hinder the Humours from falling upon the Joints, and help Dige≈øtion, and if performed in due Time, that is, having ea≈øed the Body of its Excrements, they chear the Body, and corroborate the natural Heat, and excite the vital Faculties; whence the Di≈øtribution and Concoction of the Food is more ea≈øie and ready. They are very proper for old Men in the Summer and in the Autumn, having fir≈øt voided the Excrements of the Belly and Bladder.</p>
               <p>The U≈øe of Ligatures is rare now a-days, for they do not that which many expect from them, they are ≈øometimes u≈øed in violent Hemorrhagies, ≈øo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People are wont to bind the Fingers of a VVoman that has too many of her Cour≈øes with Silk, and the Arms and Legs for bleeding at the No≈øe.</p>
               <p>An actual Cautery is a red hot Iron of a certain Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure to burn ≈øome Part of the Body; it is u≈øed to ≈øtop hurt Arteries, and a Flux of Blood. It is al≈øo u≈øed for a Caries of the Bones, and to make I≈ø≈øues: But this is counted a cruel Remedy, and is therefore ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom u≈øed, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing the thing can be done by a potential Cautery.</p>
               <p>A potential Cautery, or an E≈øchareotic is of great U≈øe in Phy≈øick for opening the Brea≈øt, Impo≈øthumes, and for taking off proud Fle≈øh; but Care mu≈øt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Nerves, Tendons, and great Ve≈ø≈øels. Care mu≈øt be al≈øo taken that the Cau≈øtic do not lye long, or di≈ø≈øolve ≈øo much as to corrode the neighbouring Parts. To prevent this, Plai≈øters with Holes in them are fir≈øt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63575:86"/>to be applied to the Part for a Defen≈øive, and the Cau≈øtic is put into the Hole, or it is kept clo≈øe by half a Nut-≈øhell bound hard on.</p>
               <p>Bli≈øters are al≈øo of the Nature of a Cau≈øtic, and work much after the ≈øame manner, only they are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They are of great U≈øe in malignant Fevers and ≈øleepy Di≈øea≈øes, and in other Di≈øea≈øes, when we would evacuate ≈øome acrid Humour from the Blood: But in the Application of them care mu≈øt be taken of the Tendons and Nerves.</p>
               <p>I≈ø≈øues are certain ≈ømall Ulcers mady by Art in divers Parts, they are made either by an actual or potential Cautery, or they are cut. They are frequently made in the Limbs, and ≈øometimes, tho rarely, in the Neck. In making of them have a care of the Beginning of the Mu≈øcle, chu≈øe the Middle or the End of it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways let the Place be betwixt two Mu≈øcles, as in the Arm betwixt the Deltois and Biceps; in the Thigh in the In≈øide the Di≈øtance of two tran≈øver≈øe Fingers above the Knee.</p>
               <p>I≈ø≈øues evacuate noxious and ≈øuperfluous Humours, whil≈øt they di≈øtill betwixt the Mu≈øcles, or are carryed about them with the Arterial Blood; therefore they are of great U≈øe, and prevent Di≈øea≈øes.</p>
               <p>A Seton is a ≈øilken Thred, or a Skein of Silk waxed, and with a Needle, conveyed through the Fle≈øh. It is made in the Neck, betwixt the fir≈øt Vertebra and the fifth, al≈øo in the Legs and Arm; at the Beginning you mu≈øt provide again≈øt an Inflammation; therefore apply Dige≈øtives. The Skein mu≈øt be dayly moved till the Di≈øea≈øe cea≈øes; it works more powerfully than an I≈ø≈øue, but is much more trouble≈øome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ≈øeldom ordered till that has been found inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
               <p>The general Ends of I≈ø≈øues is the Evacuation of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offending and dayly accruing.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:63575:87"/>
               <p>I≈ø≈øues as well as Bli≈øters drain out what≈øoever Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are fixed within the Skin, and anticipate morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic Humours that are wont to be carried to other Parts that were before weak and long afflicted, and ≈øo free ≈øometimes one Part, ≈øometimes another, and like a Bullwark defend them from the Enemy; hence the Matter, whether arthritic or nephritic, or colical, yea ≈øometimes the paralitic or the ≈øcorbutic Matter as it pa≈ø≈øes out of its Fountains to its Ne≈øts, or di≈øea≈øed Parts is often intercepted, and ≈øo is carried out. I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øues al≈øo, like VVater-furrows, made to drain the Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine≈øs of the Earth do by little and little drain out the Humours that are ≈øettled in any Part or Region of the Body, and are there doing Harm, and ≈øo they either prevent or cure a morbific Di≈øpo≈øition.</p>
               <p>From the≈øe various ways of helping, whereby I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øues are wont in general to profit, it is ea≈øily gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for what Di≈øea≈øes they are chiefly requi≈øite; for tho there be almo≈øt no Di≈øea≈øe to which this Remedy is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurtful or unprofitable, yet it ≈øeems more nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary in ≈øome Ca≈øes than in others, it is commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed for almo≈øt all Di≈øea≈øes of the Head both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and external, for the convul≈øive Motions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and Children, for their Ophthalmy and ≈øtrumous Humours; nor is this Remedy in le≈øs Repute for Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes of the Brea≈øt, as al≈øo for tho≈øe of the lower Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But however profitable and benign it be of it ≈øelf, it is not agreeable for all; for there are two Sorts of Men, who tho they are di≈øea≈øed, may not have I≈ø≈øues, namely, becau≈øe it evacuates too much in ≈øome, and in others le≈øs than it ought, and in the mean time is very painful. Fir≈øt, it is not convenient when it eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuates too much, or ≈øpends the Moi≈øture of the Spirits. It has been ob≈øerved in ≈øome, that an I≈ø≈øue made in any Part of the Body pours out an Ichor immoderate in Quantity, and vitious in Quality, which is thin and ≈øtinking, and often colours the Pea≈øe and Coverings
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63575:87"/>black, and by the too great Flux thereof, the Strength and Fle≈øh are wa≈øted; for the corruptive Teint of the I≈ø≈øue being communicated to the Blood, does in ≈øome ≈øort deprave the whole Ma≈øs, whereby it is rendred le≈øs nutritious. Secondly, I≈ø≈øues are forbidden, ≈øome on another, and indeed, on a different Account, namely, becau≈øe when they evacuate little or nothing, they vex and pain very much the Part wherein they are made; for ≈øuch as are of a choleric and hot Temper have the their Ma≈øs of Blood thicker, and le≈øs diluted with Serum than it ≈øhould be, and the Frame of it too ≈øtrict; and ≈øuch a Solution of Continuity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made and continued for the I≈ø≈øue, the Blood it ≈øelf ≈øticks in the Pa≈ø≈øage, and ≈øo being extrava≈øated, cau≈øes a very painful Inflammation, and in the mean while, ≈øeeing ≈øuch an I≈ø≈øue pours out but very little Ichor, it is as unprofitable as trouble≈øome.</p>
               <p>For Di≈øea≈øes of the Brea≈øt I≈ø≈øues between the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blades, as al≈øo in the Arm or Leg are good to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate and anticipate the Humours that are flowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lungs, as al≈øo to call out tho≈øe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready depo≈øited there.</p>
               <p>We know by Experience how an I≈ø≈øue made in the Thorax it ≈øelf, between the Rips, does ≈øometimes more immediately derive the tabific Matter from the Lungs. <hi>Aquapent</hi> orders the making two I≈ø≈øues in the Hollow under the Middle of the Collar Bones again≈øt Di≈øtillations upon the Brea≈øt.</p>
               <p>By an I≈ø≈øue in the Groin is ≈øometimes happily cured, a great Lumbago or Pain in the Loins, when it would yield to no other Remedy, al≈øo an inveterate Sciatica; for the glandulous Emunctories that are in that Place imbibe very many Recrements of the Blood and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Liquor, which if they be forthwith and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øent from them by a fit Emi≈ø≈øary, mu≈øt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to free the neighbouring Parts from any morbific Minerals. Such have I≈ø≈øues made in the Groin
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63575:88"/>as are not married, and ≈øuch as are well in Years. They are approved for the Cholic and Pains of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the Gout, and a ≈øtubborn Itch.</p>
               <p>Some in <hi>England</hi> are of Opinion that an I≈ø≈øue di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes to Barrenne≈øs, on which Account married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ≈øuch as de≈øign Children, are ≈øtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the U≈øe of them, and certain barren Women that had I≈ø≈øues are alledged; it were ea≈øie to mention many more barren Women that have no I≈ø≈øues, and many fruitful Women that have.</p>
               <p>Let the Bandage of the I≈ø≈øue be moderately tyed, for a loo≈øe Bandage keeps not the Pea in the I≈ø≈øue, and a too ≈øtrict one pre≈ø≈øes out all the Moi≈øture, and cau≈øes the I≈ø≈øue to become quite dry. A Lady wore an I≈ø≈øue in her left Arm for many Years with very great Benefit, but by a too ≈øtrict Bandage the Place of the I≈ø≈øue was ≈øo compre≈ø≈øed, that there ≈øeemed to be nothing but Skin and Bone, and upon leaving the Fillet off, and by applying only a ≈øtrengthening Plai≈øter, the I≈ø≈øue ran very well.</p>
               <p>Before an I≈ø≈øue is dryed up, you mu≈øt con≈øider the Age, the Con≈øtitution of the Body, the Matter offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Part ≈øending, and the Part receiving. If an Infant being troubled with the Falling-≈øickne≈øs, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, an I≈ø≈øue be made in the Nape of the Neck, and a regular Diet withall be pre≈øcribed the Nur≈øe, and fitting Medicines given, whereby the Fuel of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe may be ≈øub≈øtracted, and the Head ≈øtrengthened, ≈øo that there be no Su≈øpicion of the Return of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady for a Year together, the I≈ø≈øue may be ≈øafely clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed up; for if it ≈øhould be continued any longer, the good Juices may flow out as well as the bad, and the Part may be debilitated. In a Man of middle Age, his pre≈øent State is to be compared with the former, which if it be become better, and while the I≈ø≈øue has ran he has not ≈øuffered a Relap≈øe, it may by little and little be obliterated in the Nape of the Neck, or in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63575:88"/>the fore Part of the Head, by le≈ø≈øening the Pea by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and a new one may be made in the Arm for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, which al≈øo for a while may be dryed up. But let old Men wear them to the la≈øt, namely, tho≈øe who≈øe natural Heat is weak, and in whom there flows out Plenty of Matter. VVe mu≈øt con≈øider al≈øo in VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, whether the innate Heat be ≈øo brisk, as altogether to con≈øume the morbific Matter, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the offending Matter find ≈øome other VVay. From all which we may infer that there is no definite Time of wearing an I≈ø≈øue, and that Death does not always follow clo≈øing them up.</p>
               <p>The Ancients practi≈øed Scarification far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently and frequently than we now a-days, who u≈øe it in no other Ca≈øes than in the Application of Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-gla≈ø≈øes, and in the Cure of Gangreens: But it is of wonderful Efficacy to ea≈øe all Pains that invade the outward Part of the Body: One being afflicted Night and Day for many Months together with venereal Pains in his Leg, and could be ea≈øed by no Medicines, was cured by the Help of Scarification.</p>

               <p>Bathing wears off La≈ø≈øitudes, for it ≈øupples the Joints, and loo≈øens the Skin; wherefore whether a Man be troubled with ≈øpontaneous or non≈øpontaneous La≈ø≈øitudes, he can u≈øe nothing better than a Bath, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs there be either ≈øuch a Fullne≈øs or Badne≈øs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that it is fitting to bleed or purge fir≈øt.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX. </hi>Of Alexipharmics, Cordials, Diaphoretics, Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and Anodynes.</head>
               <p>THo≈øe are reckoned for Cordials that a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Heart labouring in any kind; wherefore one is ≈øaid by Authors notably to ≈øtrengthen the Heart, another to keep it unhurt by any Putrefaction, others to relieve a weak oppre≈ø≈øed Heart, to cure its <hi>Tremor</hi> or Fainting, and to pre≈øerve it from Corruption. Moreover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe in the Plague, Small-pox, and malignant Fevers, the Heart is believed to be ≈øeized or be≈øet with Poy≈øon or Malignity; therefore the Remedies that are wont to help in the≈øe Di≈øea≈øes are not called ≈øimply Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, but Alexiteries, and Alexipharmics. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning both Cordial and Alexiterial Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ≈øeems to ri≈øe from hence, in as much as the Heart is commonly believed to be the Beginning of all Life and Heat, and that therefore our Health and Death depend on its immediate Affection, hence what things ≈øoever recreate the Soul are ≈øuppo≈øed to do it, as they are benign and friendly to the Heart.</p>
               <p>As to Cordials, by which the too ≈øtrait Frame of the efferve≈øcing Blood is loo≈øened and opened for the ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at Liberty the febrile Matter, and other Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho≈øe are of Affinity with ≈øome Diuretics and Diaphoretics, yea, ≈øometimes they are of common or reciprocal U≈øe, in as much as the vitiated Cra≈øis of the Blood ≈øometimes cannot be relieved, unle≈øs its Frame being fir≈øt unlocked, there lye open an Exit for di≈øcharging the Serum by the Reins, or the Pores of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63575:89"/>the Skin. Saline Medicines do chiefly execute all the≈øe Intentions of Cure; for the opening of any Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liquid or ≈øolid, is hardly performed but by a ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Key; for commonly all Concretion or Compacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from a Salt of one Sort, and the Di≈ø≈øolution from ≈øome of another Sort that ≈ønatches into its Embraces the fir≈øt Salt; therefore we reckon Salines among Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, no le≈øs than among Diuretics and Diaphoretics; becau≈øe there is the ≈øame Rea≈øon in all. In the fir≈øt Rank Cordials indued with a volatile Salt offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, and are ju≈øtly preferrable to all the re≈øt, as Spirit of Harts-horn, of Blood, of Sal-armoniac, the Spirit of Sculls, the Salt of Vipers, and the Powder of Toads; ≈øuch Remedies as the≈øe have recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many from the very Jaws of Death.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond Place among Saline Cordials is of Right owing to Remedies indued with an Alcalizat Salt; for the≈øe are commonly reputed notable Cordials; of this Sort are the Bezoar Stone, Pearls, Corals, the Bone of a Stag's Heart, the Horn of the ≈øame, the Powder of Ivory, the Eyes and Claws of Crabs, and other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Stones and Shells, which common Experience witne≈ø≈øes to be often given with Benefit. To this Cla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis of Cordials are Bole-armenic, Lemnian, and ≈øeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Earths, and other chalky Medicines de≈øervedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, but not upon the Account that they ≈øuccour the labouring Heart, but becau≈øe they de≈øtroy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancies of an acid or fixed Salt, either in the Bowels or in the Ma≈øs of Blood, and correct the Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities produced thereby.</p>
               <p>Acid Medicines, or ≈øuch as are indued with a fluid Salt are to be reckoned in the Li≈øt of Cordials, for the≈øe are e≈øteemed by mo≈øt to be notable Alexiteries again≈øt the Pe≈øtilence, wherefore in the Cure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers, Treacle and Bezoartic Vinegars are highly cryed up, yea, Vinegar or acid things are u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ingredients in Waters di≈øtilled for the ≈øame U≈øe:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63575:90"/>For the ≈øame Rea≈øon Spirit of Vitriol, the Juice of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, Sorrel, Pomgranates, and the like, are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Cordials, and Alexiteries, and that indeed ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becau≈øe the≈øe do excellently di≈ø≈øolve the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of fixed Salts with adu≈øt Sulphur; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by ≈øuch Remedies as the≈øe, the Coagulations and Extrava≈øations of the Blood that u≈øe to happen in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers are often prevented or cured. For the ≈øame Rea≈øons for which the fore≈øaid ≈øaline Medicines are reckoned for Cordials, others al≈øo, who≈øe Ba≈øis is a fixt Salt, are reputed ≈øuch, or are put into their Compo≈øitions; for ≈øeeing Salts of divers Sorts are bred in our Body, and they commonly pa≈øs from one State to another, hence not one Kind of Salt, but Salts of different Kinds ought to be given according as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is. A nitrous Salt is al≈øo ju≈øtly numbred among≈øt Cordials, and is accounted a famous Antipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic, in that it takes away Thir≈øt, and bridles the febrile Heat.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ≈øome Medicines have the Name of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, becau≈øe they exert their Virtues upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and more immediately than upon the Blood. The≈øe Medicines are fitly enough reduced to two Heads, and as they are gentle or rugged, attain the ≈øame Scope, namely, they either erect and confirm the animal Spirits by cheri≈øhing, and as it were, gently and ≈øoftly ≈øtroaking of them, or el≈øe by vexing, and as it were, ≈øpurring of them, they drive them into quicker, and ≈øometimes more regular Motions. The Cordials of the fir≈øt Sort, as ≈øoon as they are ≈øwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay ≈øometimes, being but ta≈øted, exert their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and by a grateful Appul≈øe, recruit the Spirits that re≈øide in the fir≈øt Ways; then by the Continuity of the≈øe, the ≈øame Ovation being communicated ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øively to the other Spirits, ≈øhortly undulates through the whole Frame of the ≈øen≈øitive Soul, ≈øo that both the Brain, and al≈øo the <hi>Praecordia</hi> being irritated with a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63575:90"/>fuller influx of the Spirits, exulting as it were, they perform their Functions more briskly and chearfully. For this purpo≈øe ≈øerve the Waters commonly called Cordial; al≈øo the preparations of Musk and Amber, and the Aromatic Powders that are mixed with them. Such things as have a grateful Savour or Smell, or are plea≈øant to look upon, ina≈ømuch as they recreate the Animal Spirits, are reckoned al≈øo among Cordials. In the mean time, other Cordials of this Cla≈ø≈øis, the fir≈øt ways and ma≈øs of Blood being almo≈øt untouched, ≈øeem to operate fir≈øt of all in the Brain; of which ≈øort are ≈øome Cephalics, as Sage, Betony, Ro≈øemary, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain, and the like. There are another ≈øort of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials that operate in a different manner, and help wholly on another Account: The≈øe do not gently che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh the Animal Spirits, and cau≈øe them to be expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally, but rather irritate them, and make them run and be carried this way and that way; and being thereby rouzed, they leave their former Di≈øorders, and of their own accord return into regular Order. Thus it is u≈øual in Swooning, Fainting, Oppre≈ø≈øion, or Spa≈øm of the Heart; and in almo≈øt any other fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, languors, or irregularities of the Spirits, to give inwardly Spirits of Harts-horn, of Soot, of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, or Tincture of Ca≈øtor, or <hi>A≈ø≈øa Fatida,</hi> with other Liquors: Or to hold to the No≈øe the≈øe and the like, as e≈øpecially Volatile Salts, and Empyreumatical Chymical Oyls. Be≈øides, it may be ≈øometimes good in ≈øuddain defections of the Soul, to ≈øprinkle Cold Water on the Face, to pinch the No≈øe, to ≈øhake the Body very much, and ≈øometimes to ≈øtrike a Box on the Ear: Such Admini≈øtrations as the≈øe give help, ina≈ømuch as they Rouze up the Animal Spirits, being oppre≈ø≈øed or di≈øtracted, or imployed other ways than they ≈øhould, and Command them to their former Offices.</p>
               <p>Great Caution is needful, that Men indulge not them≈øelves too much in the u≈øe of Cordials; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63575:91"/>eminent Men and Women, from the more frequent u≈øe of the≈øe, fall into this ≈øad Cu≈øtom, that it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nece≈ø≈øary to take a Draught often in a Day, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ≈øome generous Wine or Spirit, or ≈øome ≈øtrong Water; yea moreover, Nature being a little accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtomed to extraordinaries, remains not long content with the ≈øame, and therefore they increa≈øe them daily, and repeat them oftener; ≈øo that at length the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach can bear, or dige≈øt nothing moderate, but ≈øtill de≈øires ≈øtronger and hotter; and the other Vi≈øcera, e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Liver, are ≈øo dryed and parched thereby, that the Blood being le≈ø≈øened as to its quantity, and depraved as to its Cra≈øis, Di≈øea≈øes and Death ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene.

               <p>Diaphoretics, as to the way of their working and operations, have great Affinity with mo≈øt Cardiacs, commonly ≈øo called, in≈øomuch that many of both kinds are of a common or reciprocal u≈øe; and ≈øeeing they differ chiefly, only as to their greater or le≈ø≈øer efficacy, when we are bound to pa≈øs from one Genus to the other, generally we need only increa≈øe or le≈ø≈øen the Do≈øe, and chu≈øe the fitte≈øt time for admini≈øtring them.</p>
               <p>As to the various kinds, and preparations of the Matter, whereof Sudorific Medicines are made, they are generally either the integral, or elementary Parts of ≈øome mixed Body, <hi>viz.</hi> Either natural Concretes are given in their whole Sub≈øtance, either ≈øimple or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, as when the Leaves, Roots, or Seeds of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus, Contrayerva, Angelica,</hi> or the like, are taken in Powder, Decoction, Con≈øerve or Magi≈øtery; or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretics con≈øi≈øt of the Particles of this or that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> ≈øpirituous, ≈øulphureous, or ≈øaline, either ≈øimple, or ≈øome prevailing over other: As if a Salt, Spirit, or Oyl be extracted from Carduus, or other vegetable, mineral, or animal Body, and be reduced into the Form of a Medicine, either by it ≈øelf, or with other Preparations.</p>
               <p>We will briefly run over all, or at lea≈øt the chief Species of them. Fir≈øt, Diaphoretics, who≈øe Vertue con≈øi≈øts in the Integral Particles of the whole Concrete, being unequally mixt, ≈øeem to be indued with ≈øome
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63575:92"/>one Element more eminent than the re≈øt, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and to owe their Vertue chiefly to it. Now that Salt upon which the hydrotic Vertue depends, comes under a double State; for in ≈øome Concretes it is vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and acrimonious, or bitter; in others alcalizate and fixt in a ≈øort; fir≈øt, in the former Rank are mo≈øt Vegetables e≈øteem'd Antidotes by the Ancients, ≈øuch are the Leaves of Scordium, Carduus, Scabious, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkle, the Flowers of Marygold, Camomile, the Roots of Burdock, Zedoary, Galingal, and the like; al≈øo the Confections of Mithridate, Treacle, Dia≈øcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, the Decoctions of Guiacum, Box, and the like, are reckoned among the≈øe. Secondly, The other ≈øort of Diaphoretics which, while they con≈øi≈øt of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral Parts, of the mixt, have an alcali Salt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as Stones, and the bony or ≈øhelly Parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Vegetables, as Bezoar, Pearls, the Eyes and Claws of Crabs, and the like, who≈øe Diaphoretic Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue proceeds chiefly from an alcali Salt. Hydrotic Medicines al≈øo, which after a ≈øpagyrical Analy≈øis, owe their Vertue to this or that ≈øort of elementary Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, being framed out of divers Subjects, and with a different Preparation, are chiefly either ≈øpirituous or ≈øaline, or both together combined one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or with ≈øome ≈øulphureous Particles; for ≈øuch as are wholly, or for the greate≈øt Part ≈øulphureous, are le≈øs proper for this Intention. To the ≈øpirituous we refer hot Waters, and all ≈øorts of Liquors indued with a vinous Spirit, ≈øuch as are commonly di≈øtilled by Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øtry out of the Fruits or Juices of Vegetables, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by Fermentation, or re≈øolved by Putrefaction, as the Spirits of Wine, of the Berries of Juniper and Elder, of black Cherries, and the like. Such vinous Liquors as the≈øe being taken inwardly, procure Sweat.</p>
               <p>Saline Preparations al≈øo of divers kinds, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent States are pre≈øcribed ≈øucce≈øsfully for the procuring Sweat.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:63575:93"/>
               <p>To Diaphoretics, who≈øe Ba≈øis are Spirits, with the other elementary Particles combined (as for example, a Dram of Mixtura Simplex in a convenient Vehicle) are referred tho≈øe which con≈øi≈øt of a Spirit; a fixt Salt or Sulphur combined; of which ≈øort are the Tincture of Salt of Tartar and Antimony, the Do≈øe whereof is from one Scruple to two in ≈øome Liquor. Moreover, di≈øtilled Waters, wherein the ≈øpirituous Particles are diluted with the watry, u≈øe to be given with Succe≈øs for provoking Sweat; the Do≈øes of the fore≈øaid Waters may be actuated by the Addition of chymical Liquors or Salts. Medicines of this ≈øort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with a vinous Spirit are chiefly, and almo≈øt ≈øolely profitable for old Men, and for ≈øuch as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a cold Temperament, or are ≈øubject to the Pal≈øy or Drop≈øy. But in a hot Con≈øtitution, and where there is a Heat of the Vi≈øcera, or a febrile Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferve≈øcence of the Blood, they u≈øe to do more Hurt than Good, in as much as they rarifie the former, and accend the latter too much. The Diaphoretics which have a ≈øaline Ba≈øis, as they are of a various Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> accordingly, as it is a volatile, fixed, ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, or nitrous Salt, ≈øo they are of a different U≈øe and Operation, whence in ≈øome Ca≈øes one ≈øort is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in others another, or another. A fixt and volatile Salt are be≈øt for tho≈øe who≈øe Blood is very full of a ≈øerous Humour: Be≈øides, if the Liquor that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the <hi>Vi≈øcera</hi> and <hi>Genus Nervo≈øum</hi> do at any time wax eager, as it u≈øes to do in Drop≈øies and Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in tho≈øe who are ≈øubject to ≈øpa≈ømodic Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes; the≈øe Medicines are more profitably admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtred for procuring Sweat. Diaphoretics al≈øo which have a nitrous Salt for their Ba≈øis, ≈øeem to help in the ≈øame Ca≈øes, almo≈øt as the former, con≈øi≈øting of a fixt and volatile Salt. Diaphoretics, who≈øe Ba≈øis is an acid Salt, are chiefly profitable again≈øt the Predominancies of a fixt Salt or Sulphur.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:63575:93"/>
               <p>Some Medicines that are wholly, or for the greate≈øt part ≈øulphureous, are commonly reckoned in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Diaphoretics, as ≈øome natural Bal≈øoms, and ≈øome factitious ones, al≈øo chymical Oyls, e≈øpecially tho≈øe of Guiacum, Box, Camphor, Harts-horn, and Soot; likewi≈øe the re≈øinous Extracts of heavy Woods, with many others, which tho of them≈øelves they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce little towards the provoking of Sweat, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined with other ≈øaline things, they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unprofitable, in as much as in a colder and too phlegmatic Con≈øtitution, ≈øulphureous ≈øaline Remedies do rarifie the over-watry Blood, and di≈øpo≈øe it to a freer Evaporation, no le≈øs than ≈øpirtuous things.</p>
               <p>The Ba≈øis of a ≈øudorific Diet-drink are the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Liquors for the curing of the Pox, and ≈øome other chronical Di≈øea≈øes deeply rooted in the Blood and Humours; for very inten≈øe and frequent ≈øweating, daily for a long time, is requi≈øite for the Cure of ≈øome Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes, <hi>viz.</hi> not only that the Impurities and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Vi≈øcera and Humours may be carried off, but al≈øo, that the morbific Tinctures that are deeply imprinted thereupon may be wholly de≈øtroyed: For this purpo≈øe it will not be enough to give ≈øome ≈øudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic Powder or Bolus now and then, but an entire Diet ought to be ordered for this Intention; wherefore let all the Drink be a ≈øudorific Decoction, after one Do≈øe whereof taken in the Morning, let plentiful ≈øweating be provoked, making u≈øe be≈øides of the Heat of a Bath or Hot-hou≈øe. Moreover, ≈øeeing by this means both the Pores of the Skin are unlockt, and Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo is inclined to ≈øweating all the Day after, the Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Blood and nervous Juice will evaporate by Per≈øpiration continued all along by the U≈øe of the ≈øame Drink. By this Method, not only the French Pox is ≈øafely, and for the mo≈øt part very certainly cured, but al≈øo ≈øome other ≈øtubborn herculean Di≈øea≈øes are ≈øometimes happily remedied.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:63575:94"/>
               <p>All Humours are not profitably le≈ø≈øened and evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Sweat, but only ≈øome; not Blood nor Choler, but all ≈øorts of Flegm, and all Serum, as well the watry as the ≈øalt Muriatic, the acid and ≈øowr. But gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Flegm, ≈øeeing it is not ≈øo fit for Motion, ought fir≈øt, or at the ≈øame time, to be incided, attenuated, and made fluid, that it may the more ea≈øily be driven forth by or with Sweat. An acid ≈øowr Humour ought al≈øo to be prepared for its Expul≈øion by Sweat. That the mentioned Humours are driven and expelled by the Pores of the Skin, and ≈øo by Sweat, appears by the Sweat it ≈øelf, which ≈øometimes comes forth glutinous, often watry and in≈øipid, ≈øometimes muriatic or brine-like, ≈øometimes al≈øo ≈øomewhat acid or ≈øowr.</p>
               <p>There are but few true ≈øudorific Medicines, and among the≈øe Opium is the chief; for the rea≈øon why Treacle or Mithridate cau≈øe Sweat, is wholly from the Opium that is mixed with them: For the≈øe two Electuaries prepared without Opium do not provoke Sweat at all.</p>
               <p>The mo≈øt convenient Time for ≈øweating is the Morning, and that on an empty Stomach; for then the Sweat comes out more ea≈øily and plentifully. Note, that after ≈øweating Decoctions, purging is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to carry off the gro≈øs Excrements.</p>
               <p>The Origins of many Di≈øea≈øes happen for want of a due Separation of the Serum; but as to this Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ≈øeeing there are Faults of divers Kinds, the Offence is for the mo≈øt part either in Defect or in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs; for ≈øometimes the Serum does too pertinaciou≈øly adhere to the Blood, and on the contrary, ≈øometimes it parts too ≈øoon from it, and in this regard the Blood being not able to contain the Serum, doth ≈øpue it out of the Mouths of the Arteries in many Places, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt every where, and ≈øo depo≈øiting it in the Vi≈øcera or Habit of the Body, occa≈øions an A≈øcites or Ana≈øar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; and ≈øometimes, ≈øending it off immoderately to the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63575:94"/>Kidneys, it cau≈øes a Diabetes, when the Blood is too tenacious of the Serum; for the mo≈øt part it is either over-hot through a Fever, having its Frame too ≈øtrict, and the thicker Particles ≈øo incorporated with it, that the thinner cannot ea≈øily get therefrom; or being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ≈øcorbutic Salt and Sulphur, it becomes very clammy and tenacious, ≈øo that the Sero≈øities difficultly ≈øeparate from the re≈øt. And ≈øeeing the Departure of the Serum from the Blood is hindred or perverted ≈øo many ways, diuretic Medicines al≈øo are of a different Nature and Operation, which yet may be di≈øtingui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fir≈øt, as to the End, according to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect the Ma≈øs of Blood, or the Kidneys, or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Secondly, as to the matter, in which re≈øpect they are either ≈øulphureous or ≈øaline; and the≈øe again are various, according as the ≈øaline Particles are in a State of Fixity, Fluor, or volatility; or are moreover nitrous or alcalizate. Thirdly, As to the Form; the≈øe Medicines are of divers Kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Drinks, Powders, and the like.</p>
               <p>When the Blood, through an Incorporation, and mutual Combination of the fixt Salt with the Sulphur and Earth becomes ≈øo thick and tenacious, that the Watry Particles do not ea≈øily part from the re≈øt, the Diuretics, which may loo≈øen its Frame, and fu≈øe the Serum, mu≈øt be of ≈øuch a Sort as are endued with a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile or acid Salt; for ≈øuch Particles do chiefly di≈ø≈øolve the Combination that the fixt Salt has entred into. And ≈øeeing this Di≈øpo≈øition is common, both to the Fever and Scurvy; in the former the mo≈øt proper Dinreties are both the temperate Acids of Vegetables, and al≈øo the Salt of Nitre, the Spirit of Sea-≈øalt, of Vitriol, and the like; likewi≈øe tho≈øe endued with a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt, as the Spirit of Harts-horn, of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, the Salt of the Juice of Vipers. In a ≈øcorbutical Di≈øpo≈øition, when the Urine is both little and thick, the Juices of Herbs and acrimonious and acid Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63575:95"/>are of notable U≈øe, al≈øo the Salt and Spirit of Urine, of Sal Armoniac, of Tartar, and the like.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Blood keeps not its Serum long enough within its Compages, but being ≈øubject to Fluxions, or rather Coagulations, it depo≈øites the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum here and there in great Plenty: It rai≈øes Catarrhs or Humours in divers Places, or the Blood being habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually weak, and inclining to Sowrne≈øs, is apt to coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate as to its thicker Particles, ≈øo that in the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the thinner being thrown off every where, and falling upon the weaker Parts, cau≈øe ≈øometimes cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or thoracic Di≈øtempers; ≈øometimes an A≈øcites, or Ana≈øarca, and from a like Cau≈øe we think a Diabetes al≈øo ≈øprings; for many dangerous Di≈øea≈øes, which are erroneou≈øly a≈øcribed to the Di≈øcra≈øies of the Vi≈øcera, ari≈øe from this Cau≈øe; namely, in as much as the Blood, being of an evil Temper, and liable to Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, cannot continue the Thred of the Circulation entire, but in divers Places depo≈øites the Serum that is too apt to depart from it. The Diuretics to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtred in this Ca≈øe are ≈øuch as do not fu≈øe the Blood, but take away its Coagulations, as are tho≈øe endued with a fixt, volatile, and al≈øo an alcalizate Salt. Moreover, tho≈øe that ≈øtrengthen and re≈øtore the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kidneys for the≈øe Purpo≈øes are ≈øulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and mixt Diuretics, the lixivial Salts of Herbs, Shell-powders, the Salt and Spirit of Urine, and the like; Hog-lice, the Roots of Hor≈øe-radi≈øh, the Seeds of Smallage, Nutmeg, Turpentine, and its Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Spirit of Wine: The Vertue of all which is not to fu≈øe the Blood, and to precipitate the Sero≈øities out of its Ma≈øs, but to di≈ø≈øolve the Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Blood, ≈øo that its Compages recovering an entire Mixture, and being circulated more quickly through the Ve≈ø≈øels, it re≈øorbs the Serum that was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where extrava≈øated and depo≈øited, and at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers it to the Kidneys to be ≈øent off.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:63575:95"/>
               <p>Among the Diuretics endued with an acid Salt, are the Spirits of Salt or Nitre, al≈øo the Juice of Lemons and Sorrel; white Rheni≈øh Wine and Cider are of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Note with the Vulgar, for the≈øe alone fu≈øe the Blood, and precipitate it into its Sero≈øities, as when an Acid is poured into boyling Milk: But this happens not alike to all. In an healthful Con≈øtitution the Salt of the Blood is partly fixt, partly nitrous, and partly volatile; al≈øo in ≈øome ≈øcorbutical and drop≈øical People, it becomes commonly fixt; wherefore in all the≈øe Ca≈øes, Diuretics endued with an acid Salt are given with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs: But in catarrhous Di≈øtempers, and in ≈øome drop≈øical and ≈øcorbutic, when the ≈øaline fixt Particles of the Blood are promoted to a State of Fluor, and the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile are depre≈ø≈øed, as often happens, acetous Remedies u≈øe to do more Hurt than Good, in as much as they yet more pervert the Blood that is already degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from its right Cra≈øis, ≈øo that Medicines indued with a fixt or volatile Salt will be more profitable for the≈øe: As for example,
<q>Take of choice white Tartar, of Sal-prunella, each a Dram and an half, of Crabs-Eyes one Dram, make a Powder; the Do≈øe whereof is from half a Dram to two Scruples, in a fit Vehicle, once in ≈øix or eight Hours.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That Medicines indued with a fixt or lixivial Salt provoke Urine, appears plainly enough from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and empirical Remedy, that is wont to be given for the Cure of Drop≈øies, <hi>viz.</hi> it is u≈øual in an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarca, and ≈øometimes in an A≈øcites, when the Bowels or Fle≈øh ≈øwell very much, by a Collection of Water, to give to drink a Ly made of the A≈øhes of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Broom, or Bean-≈øtalks infu≈øed in White-wine, whereupon it often happens that there follows a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Evacuation of Urine, and the Di≈øea≈øe is cured. Yet it has been ob≈øerved, that in ≈øome, that Remedy has not proved diuretic, and has rather increa≈øed than cured the drop≈øical Di≈øpo≈øition. The Rea≈øon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63575:96"/>whereof appears from what has been ≈øaid above, <hi>viz.</hi> that lixivial Salts do not fu≈øe or precipitate either Milk or Blood, and therefore are not Diuretics in their proper Nature. Neverthele≈øs that Effect ≈øometimes follows, in as much as a fixt Salt being taken plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, de≈øtroys the Energy of an Acid and coagulative Salt prevailing in the Blood, ≈øo that the Blood being before too apt to be fu≈øed, and not able to retain its Serum, but throwing it off in every Place, does by the Advent of a fixt Salt, recover its due Cra≈øis, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore re≈øorbing the extrava≈øated Serum, and conveying it continually to the Kidneys, cau≈øes a plentiful Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Urine. As for example,
<q>Take of the Salt of Tartar or Wormwood two Drams, of Coral calcined to Whitene≈øs a Dram and an half, of Nutmeg half a Dram; make a Powder. The Do≈øe is two Scruples.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the ≈øame rea≈øon a fixt Salt is given with Succe≈øs for provoking Urine. A Volatile is al≈øo given too, in an acetous Di≈øcra≈øy of the Blood.</p>
               <p>It is known that Shell-powders, and ≈øome Stones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with an alcalizat Salt, do ≈øometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine; for in great Stoppages of Urine, the Powder of Egg-≈øhells, of Crabs-claws or Eyes, has been a pre≈øent Remedy to ≈øome. Some ≈øulphureous and ≈øpirituous Medicines are al≈øo reckoned Diuretics. Mo≈øt Medicines derived from the Pine or Larch-tree, e≈øpecially Turpentine and its Preparations, the di≈øtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Oyls of Juniper, of Nutmeg, of Wax, and other far things taken inwardly, cau≈øe in mo≈øt a plentiful Urine, and that indued with a Smell like a Violet. In ≈øome hydropical and ≈øcorbutical Per≈øons, the Spirit of Wine and ≈øtrong Waters, yea, generous Wine it ≈øelf being drunk largely has promoted the Evacuation of Urine. It is to be noted therefore that Diuretics are not indifferently convenient in any Di≈øtemper or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for the benefiting of the ≈øick, but one ≈øhould be
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63575:96"/>u≈øed in one Di≈øea≈øe or offending Humour, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in another; ≈øome indeed are good for evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Choler, and others Flegm: Proper for Choler are the Juice of Citron, the Emul≈øion of Barly, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, the Spirit of Salt, the Salt of Tartar vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and the like; and for Flegm among≈øt chimical Medicines, the volatile Salt of Urine, and all volatile Salts, the di≈øtilled Oyls of Juniper Berries, of Amber, and the like; yea, and al≈øo the Acids com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ju≈øt now for Choler, becau≈øe they no le≈øs alter Flegm (yea, Acids drive it forth by Urine) than do Aromatics, and ≈øuch as con≈øi≈øt of a volatile Salt, as Experience teaches; yet the latter are for the mo≈øt part ob≈øerved to be the better, and fitter for re≈øtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Health, ≈øeeing they not only correct Flegm, but al≈øo pre≈øerve the Choler in its natural State; but Acids, tho' they incide Flegm, and promote its pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing out by Urine, yet they do withall infringe Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and carry it from its natural State, and in that re≈øpect hurt.</p>
               <p>Diuretics are mo≈øt proper in tho≈øe Di≈øea≈øes that are firmly rooted, and have their Foundation in a tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous ≈øaline Dro≈øs, in which it is profitable to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate by little and little the occa≈øional Cau≈øe of the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe by the urinary Pa≈ø≈øages; thus in hypochondriac and ≈øcorbutic Di≈øea≈øes, we empty out of the Body tho≈øe tartareous Humours.</p>
               <p>Such Diuretics may be ≈øafely given to Infants, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Women with Child, as con≈øi≈øt of an ab≈øter≈øive Vertue; from an Alcali, and from their kindly acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, they incide and purge out the Filth of the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pa≈ø≈øages, ≈øuch are the Stones of Peaches, Crabs Eyes, <hi>Lapis Judaicus, Nephriticus,</hi> the Stones of Fruits, and their A≈øhes. Hot and dry Bodies are not long, nor vehemently to be forced to purge by Urine, by hot diuretic Decoctions; ≈øeeing by their U≈øe an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Liver, a Fever, and an Extenuation of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63575:97"/>the whole Body may follow; on the contrary, the fat, the cold, and ≈øuch as have a ≈øoft and loo≈øe Skin, and abound with watry Humours, and thin Juices, are very fit to be purged by Urine.</p>
               <p>We mu≈øt never u≈øe Diuretics, e≈øpecially ≈øuch as are vehement, in Di≈øea≈øes of the Reins and Bladder, nor in Women that are with Child, le≈øt they cau≈øe Abortion.</p>
               <p>You mu≈øt note, concerning cold Seeds, that their diuretic Vertue re≈øides mo≈øt in their Husks.</p>
               <p>Concerning the right U≈øe of opiate Medicines, the≈øe four things following are to be ob≈øerved, <hi>viz.</hi> before we give a narcotic Medicine, we mu≈øt fir≈øt con≈øider the Con≈øtitution of the Patient. Secondly, the Di≈øea≈øe that he is ill of. Thirdly, in what State the animal Spirits are in re≈øpect to both animal and vital Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Fourthly and la≈øtly, in what Condition the Blood and other Humours are. As to the fir≈øt, when an Hypnotic is indicated, ≈øee that the Temperament of the Patient, the Habit or Indi≈øpo≈øition of his Body, his Cu≈øtom, or Manner of Life do not contraindicate; as for example, tho≈øe who are indued with an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Stature, a firm and well-≈øet Body, hot Blood, a lively or ≈øharp A≈øpect, bear this Medicine be≈øt; but they take it more ≈øecurely, if they have moreover been formerly u≈øed to it: But on the contrary, it is not ≈øo convenient, yea, ≈øometimes it does a great deal of hurt to them who are over-fat or lean, as likewi≈øe to tho≈øe who being either of a rare Texture, have their Spirits ea≈øily di≈ø≈øipable, or of a cold Temperament, and have ≈øoft and flaggy Fle≈øh, and are of a ≈øluggi≈øh indocible Di≈øpo≈øition, and dull and drow≈øie of them≈øelves: To which Hindrances or Scruples this may be added, and increa≈øes the Weight of the re≈øt, <hi>viz.</hi> if they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken this Medicine before.</p>
               <p>The Nature of the Di≈øea≈øe is ≈øometimes of great moment, for or again≈øt Opiates; in ≈ølighter Di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63575:97"/>it is the part of a flattering Phy≈øician, according to <hi>Septalius,</hi> to u≈øe them. Moreover, in ≈øome great ones, their U≈øe is either forbidden, or is held very ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, in the Pal≈øy, Vertigo, Night-mare, Apoplexy, al≈øo in the Orthopnea, or Difficulty of breathing, in a Drop≈øy of the Brea≈øt, or Abdomen, in Numne≈øs, or Trembling of the Joints, in very malignant Fevers, and in Fits of Agues, or in the Cri≈øis of other Fevers, Narcotics are very often forbid. Moreover, in a Cough, with much and thick Flegm, in an A≈øthma, and in what≈øoever other Di≈øtempers of the Brea≈øt with Oppre≈ø≈øion of the Lungs, and in hy≈øterical Fits, and other convul≈øive ones, they are but ≈øeldom to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not without Caution, and the Advice of a skilful Phy≈øician: But in a cruel Head-ach, Catarrhs, Cholick, Pleuri≈øy, ordinary Fevers, vomiting, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentery, Fits of the Stone, or Gout, and in all Pains what≈øoever, Opiates are not only allowed, but we have Recour≈øe to them, as to divine Panaceas.</p>
               <p>And as often as we intend to make U≈øe of them, we mu≈øt al≈øo con≈øider in what Tenor the animal Spirits are; for if being fewer, or oppre≈ø≈øed, they already flag, and do not ≈øpread their Sails enough, certainly, they ought not to be further le≈ø≈øened, and ca≈øt down by Opiates; wherefore if ≈øo be the animal Faculties be not vigorous, both as to Sen≈øe and Di≈øcour≈øe, or do not exert them≈øelves brisk enough, or when the Pul≈øe and Re≈øpiration have the Turns of their Reciprocations, weak or flower than u≈øual; And la≈øtly, if a Numne≈øs with Enervation ≈øhall ≈øeize upon the Members, with an unwonted Languor, we mu≈øt wholly refrain from any hypnotic Medicine; but we ≈øhall not ≈øtick to u≈øe them, if they are indicated in great Di≈øea≈øes, and if withall, the animal Spirits be ≈øtrong enough in the≈øe and other re≈øpects, or become too much expanded, or immoderately fierce and outragious.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:63575:98"/>
               <p>The State of the Blood and Humours is not to be neglected, becau≈øe ≈øometimes their ill Condition does wholly forbid Opiates, or ≈øuffers them not to be u≈øed, unle≈øs ≈øparingly, and with ≈øome Re≈øtriction. The Blood does contraindicate their U≈øe, when it offends, either in Quantity or Quality, or Cra≈øis: As to the former, it either abounds or is defective, and in both re≈øpects it hinders narcotic Remedies. Nor is there le≈øs Fear of Mi≈øchief from Narcotics, as often as they are given in Defect or Penury of the Blood; as after great Hemorrhages, long Fa≈øting, or long continued Sickne≈øs.</p>
               <p>Their dayly and too frequent U≈øe is to be avoided, le≈øt the Concoction of the Stomach be le≈ø≈øened; they mu≈øt not be given at the Beginning of a Fit, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently after bleeding.</p>
               <p>The Do≈øe of Opium is ordinary or extraordinary, the ordinary Do≈øe is threefold, low, middle, and high, and it varies much according to the Preparation of the Opium; for the Do≈øe is to be con≈øidered as the Opium is mixed and compounded with other things, or as it is ≈øimple; for if it be given alone, the Do≈øe mu≈øt be le≈øs; for in≈øtance, in grown People, the lowe≈øt Do≈øe is ordinarily a quarter or half a Grain, or one Grain, the middle two Grains, or three, the highe≈øt is four or five Grains. In a Compo≈øition you mu≈øt con≈øider how much Opium is contained. Two or three Grains may be given, but four or five mu≈øt not, unle≈øs the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Do≈øes were u≈øed without Effect.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, that in Practice Opium is pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to ea≈øe Pain, to take off Watchings, and violent Symptoms, to ≈øtrengthen the Tone of the Parts, and to thicken the Blood when it is too thin, it is al≈øo mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Cephalics, Hy≈øterics, and other ≈øpecific Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and ≈øometimes with Purges.</p>
               <p>The Do≈øe is often extraordinarily increa≈øed upon the account of Cu≈øtom, the Violence of a Di≈øea≈øe, and the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63575:98"/>Diver≈øity of Temperaments. It is well known that the <hi>Turks, Per≈øians,</hi> and other oriental People, take a Dram at a time, and they are ≈øo u≈øed to it, that they cannot ab≈øtain from it without hazarding their Lives, and incurring grievous Symptoms. But the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> u≈øe it only in Medicine, and in a le≈øs Do≈øe; for if they take it freely, great Danger is occa≈øioned. A Per≈øon, by taking two and twenty Grains in a ba≈øtard Tertian, lo≈øt his Life; but <hi>Charas</hi> ≈øays, that he took ≈øix Grains, and ≈ølept no more than he u≈øed to do, and he was ≈øo far from being weakened thereby, that on the contrary, he found him≈øelf wonderfully ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; he ≈øays moreover, that he knew ≈øome weakly Men that took thirty ≈øix Grains, and were not at all injured thereby. Some People that have been afflicted with violent pocky Pains in the Joints, have taken Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Opiatum in Pills, beginning at five Grains, and ri≈øing to half a Dram; and Authors relate, that ≈øome have taken above ten Drams dayly, and yet have kept their Sen≈øes very well, ≈øo much can Cu≈øtom do; and a <hi>French</hi> Emba≈ø≈øadour in <hi>England</hi> took four Ounces of it to make him ≈øleep when he was ≈øick. <hi>Schenckius</hi> ≈øolemnly declared to his Scholars, that he often took a Scruple of Laudanum Opiatum to re≈øtrain the Motion of his Blood, for he was often troubled with a ≈øpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood and acrid Defluxions, and he ≈øaid he was not much ≈øtupified by it. And I, ≈øays <hi>Wedelius,</hi> have often given in violent Diarrheas and Dy≈øente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and for violent Pains, and in other Ca≈øes, ten Grains. But ≈øuch a high Do≈øe mu≈øt be gradually a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to, and you mu≈øt fir≈øt try what a le≈øs will do.</p>
               <p>For taking off Pain, Opium is the chief Medicine, and for cau≈øing Sleep, in doing of which it is of great U≈øe; for immoderate Watchings weaken the Body, occa≈øion Crudities, and weaken the Faculties of the Mind; tho' it mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øed that it does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63575:99"/>cau≈øe Sleep, for ≈øome it always keeps awake, and ≈øometimes it takes off Pain, tho' the Patient does not ≈øleep.</p>
               <p>It ≈øometimes occa≈øions vomiting in the Morning, in weakly and hy≈øteric Women; but this may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by their keeping their Bed long the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But whether Opium be proper in intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is a Di≈øpute among Authors; if we con≈øult the Ancients, it is certain they u≈øed Opiates to take off the Fits of Fevers; ≈øo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commends the Seeds of Henbane and Mandrakes, and <hi>Galen</hi> on the ≈øame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count every where commends Treacle: But concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continual and malignant Fevers, there is yet a greater Controver≈øy. The Ancients allowed that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um was alexipharmic; but if Caution be to be u≈øed in this matter in any Di≈øea≈øe, certainly in the≈øe; for there are many and frequent In≈øtances of the ill Effect of Opium in burning and malignant Fevers. Some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh betwixt the Times of Fevers, and they ≈øay, that Opiates are not proper in the Beginning or State; for by them the Humours are more di≈øturbed, and rendred crude, and retarded, and on this Account the Concoction and Cri≈øis hindred, but in the Declination they are ≈øo far from being injurious, that being pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently given, they do a great deal of good, by quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things, and by re≈øtoring the Strength, and the Tone of the Blood. But when violent Pains and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations are joined with Fevers, as Catarrhs, Coughs, Vomiting, Loo≈øne≈øs, and the like, it is nece≈ø≈øary to give Opiates.</p>
               <p>They are al≈øo u≈øed in the Plague, and are properly mixed with Antidotes, and Medicines again≈øt Foy≈øon: They are al≈øo of great U≈øe in the Small-pox and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øles; in a Phren≈øy they appea≈øe the raging Spirits. But <hi>Sydenham</hi> ≈øays, that when the Fever is high, they do no Good in a Phren≈øy; but that being given oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63575:99"/>in the Declination of the Di≈øea≈øe, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øucce≈øsful.</p>
               <p>For Di≈øea≈øes of the Head, they are very proper, e≈øpecially for the Pains of it, and an Hemicrany. An hypochondriac Man being among≈øt other Symptoms, afflicted with a great Vertigo, was happily cured with Laudanum Opiatum mixed with Chalybeats. But it is ≈øuppo≈øed that mad People are rendred wor≈øe by Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates; for they rave more after them.</p>
               <p>For Catarrhs and tickling Coughs they are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: But when the Matter that lyes in the Lungs is thick, and difficultly expectorated, they are injurious. The U≈øe of them is ≈øu≈øpected in an A≈øthma, and in a Pleuri≈øy narcotick Opiates mu≈øt be avoided. In a Con≈øumption they are very proper, if the Di≈øea≈øe proceed from a Flux of acrid Humours, or from ≈øpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood. But when there is an Ulcer in the Lungs, they ≈øtop Expectoration, and therefore are con≈øequently hurtful; for the ≈øick is often ≈øuffocated thereby, and therefore in ≈øuch a Ca≈øe Re≈øpect mu≈øt be always had to ea≈øe Expectoration; for as long as it proceeds well, the Life of the ≈øick is lengthened.</p>
               <p>For Di≈øea≈øes of the lower Belly, Stomach, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochonders, Opiates are of U≈øe. They are proper for the <hi>Cholera Morbus.</hi> But if the vomiting is un≈øea≈øonably ≈øtopt, great Mi≈øchiefs ari≈øe; therefore the Evacuation of the acrid and corrupt Humours mu≈øt be a while per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. For a Cardialgia Opiates are proper, and for the Hicopps they are of excellent U≈øe. For an <hi>Appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Caninus</hi> they are of good U≈øe. They are al≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Cholick mixed with Purges. For the Iliac Pa≈ø≈øion, the Bloody Flux, and the Piles, they are al≈øo very proper; ≈øo are they for the Stone, for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pains in the Gout, for hy≈øteric Di≈øea≈øes, and an immoderate Flux of the Cour≈øes.</p>
               <p>Opium is u≈øed outwardly for various Kinds of Pains, to a≈ø≈øwage violent Pains of the Head, of the Teeth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63575:100"/>and the like. Plai≈øters applied to the Temples made of Opium, are good for Watchings, Pains of the Head, and Pains of the Teeth. <hi>Hor≈øtius</hi> ≈øays, that he knew a violent bleeding, by rea≈øon an Artery was wounded, pre≈øently and wonderfully ≈øtopt, when other things could do no good, by the Application of the Magi≈øtery of Opium to the wounded Artery. <hi>Crol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> relates a de≈øperate Hemorrhage of the No≈øe was cured by ≈øtopping the No≈øtrils with two Pills made of ≈øixteen Grains of Laudanum.</p>
               <p>A Per≈øon fell into a violent Hemorrhage by drawing of a Tooth, and was cured, when other Means would not do, by Opium.</p>
               <p>Opium is al≈øo good for Ulcers in the Womb, when Pain is joined with them, for a Pain in the Teeth, a Pill of Laudanum put into the hollow Tooth, ea≈øes the Pain.</p>
               <q>Take of the be≈øt Laudanum Opiatum one Scruple, of Oyl of Camphor and Cloves, each five Drops; mingle them, and with Cotton apply it to the hollow Tooth.</q>
               <p>The Heads and Seeds of white Poppies, whereof Diacodium, al≈øo Decoctions, Emul≈øions, and other hypnotic Preparations are made, are far le≈øs indued with a narcotic Sulphur, than the concrete Juice of Opium, and what thereof is in the≈øe, is far more pure and harmle≈øs; wherefore we do oftener, and more ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely give Remedies made up of the≈øe; for it is not good to a≈øcend to Laudanum, unle≈øs, when through the Vehemence of Symptoms, Diacodiats will not do.</p>
               <p>The Ancients, who thought that Opium hurt by its exce≈ø≈øive Coldne≈øs, u≈øed altogether hot Medicines to correct it, ≈øuch as Pepper, Pyrethrum, Saffron, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtor, Euphorbium, and the like. But they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to correct Opium in that manner, by a fal≈øe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis, and they made no good Preparation of their Medicines, to ≈øpeak only of <hi>Philonjum Romanum,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63575:100"/>a ≈øufficiently frequent Medicine: Experience has taught, that by the Mixture of ≈øo many hot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, it can hardly be ≈øwallowed, but it will burn the Throat, and cau≈øe an Heat therein; and being mixed in Gli≈øters, but even to half a Dram, it has, in ≈øome, cau≈øed a great Heat in the lower Belly and ≈øtrait Gut.</p>
               <p>Opiates, tho they are divine Medicines, and tho they do a great deal of good in many Di≈øea≈øes, yet an imprudent and un≈øea≈øonable U≈øe of them has been the Death of ≈øome. It is commonly known that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Functions of the Soul are much hurt by Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; ≈øome have been made dull and ≈øtupid, and others mad, and the rea≈øon why Opium is devoured by the Turks in great Quantity, without any Harm, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever without any Danger of Life, is, becau≈øe its Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by frequent U≈øe, become agreeable and familiar; as we ob≈øerve concerning the Smoak of Tabaco taken in a Pipe; for whereas at the fir≈øt it u≈øes to cau≈øe Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine≈øs, and often vomiting or purging, cold Sweats, trembling, and often fainting; yet after a while, we take it without Di≈øturbance, yea, with great Delight; and the rea≈øon why a large Do≈øe of Opium adds Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and notable Boldne≈øs to them, ≈øo that they can enter upon a Fight without Fear, I ≈øay, the rea≈øon ≈øeems to be, becau≈øe this Medicine, by ≈øomewhat ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying the Spirits, makes them amazed, ≈øo that they can undauntedly endure the Approaches of ≈øen≈øible things how≈øoever terrible they are.</p>
               <p>When Narcotics are given with Purgers, the Quantity of the Purgers is to be increa≈øed, becau≈øe the narcotic Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue blunts them, as if half a Dram of Pil. Coch. minor is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough otherwi≈øe, let two Scruples, or two and an half be given with a Narcotic, and let Narcotics be given with Purges, that have Digridium or Coloquintida in them, whereby Nature may be ≈øollicited to Expurgation: And if the Purge ≈øtop, let it be called out by an acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63575:101"/>and provoking Gli≈øter. Ob≈øerve this carefully, when you give Narcotics with Cathartics.</p>
               <p>Let Narcotics be never taken on the Day before purging or bleeding, becau≈øe they dull the Spirits, and hinder the Blood from flowing freely; and if they are taken by the Mouth, or injected by Gli≈øters, they hinder the Operation of the Purge.</p>
               <p>To conclude, note, that Narcotics do mo≈øt Good, when Evacuations have went before. Note likewi≈øe, that it is be≈øt to begin with a ≈ømall Do≈øe, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe it as there is occa≈øion.</p>
               <p>Children do not bear Narcotics ≈øo well as the adult.</p>

               <p>DRY things are generally weighed. A Grain is the Foundation of Weight. A Scruple contains twenty Grains; a Dram three Scruples; an Ounce eight Drams. A Pound is twelve Ounces. Liquid things are mea≈øured.</p>
               <p>The Quantity of Medicines in Magnitude is pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Handfulls, Armfulls, or Pugils. A Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is that Quantity which may be held in the Hand, an≈øwerable to half an Ounce. A Pugil is either great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or le≈øs. The greater is as much as may be taken in all the five Fingers: The le≈ø≈øer as much as may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in three Fingers. The greater is in Weight a whole Dram, the le≈ø≈øer half a Dram.</p>
               <p>In Number al≈øo the Quantity of Medicines is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, and that either equally or unequally; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, three or four Lupins.</p>
               <p>Roots, Barks, and Woods are weighed: Leaves are mea≈øured by Handfulls; if they are pre≈øcribed for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63575:101"/>Baths, by Armfulls. The Do≈øes of Seeds are for the mo≈øt part expre≈ø≈øed; yet Barly and Rice are mea≈øured by the Pugil. Flowers are mea≈øured by the Pugil. Small Fruits are weighed, great are numbred. Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, Gums, and Ro≈øins are weighed. Precious Liquors and di≈øtilled Oyls are pre≈øcribed by Drops.</p>

               <p>An Apozem or Decoction is a liquid Form of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, made of divers Ingredients, and ≈øweetened with Honey or Sugar, and prepared in ≈øufficient Quantity for four or five Do≈øes, to purge or alter: That is called an altering Apozem which hath a Vertue to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Body, and things contained in it, e≈øpecially the Humours, without that vi≈øible Evacuation, which is u≈øually called purging.</p>
               <p>In the Compo≈øition of it ≈øix things are diligently to be con≈øidered; fir≈øt, The Matter out of which the Vertues are to be drawn; ≈øecondly, The Liquor into which it is to be conveyed; thirdly, The Decoction; fourthly, What things are to di≈ø≈øolved in it; fifthly, The clarifying of it; ≈øixthly, The aromatizing it. In the Matter the≈øe three things are to be regarded, the Quantity, the Quality, and the Order of Pre≈øcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Concerning the Quality, the Ingredients are chiefly Roots, Barks, Woods, Leaves, Seeds, Fruits, Flowers, Spices. The Quantity or Do≈øe is as follows. Roots are not to exceed four Ounces, or ≈øix at the mo≈øt. Barks one Ounce, or two Ounces at mo≈øt, Woods in the ≈øame Quantity. Leaves not above eight large Handfulls. Seeds to one Ounce, or an Ounce and an half. Fruits are either the le≈ø≈øer Sort, and they are pre≈øcribed from one Ounce to two Ounces; or in Number, and that u≈øually by Pairs.</p>
               <p>If they are large Fruits they are pre≈øcribed only in Number, either even or odd: If they be of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Sort, as Apples, and the like, they are pre≈øcribed by one, two, three, or the like; but if they are le≈øs, as Figs, by Pairs. Flowers from four Pugils to ≈øix.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63575:102"/>Spices are be≈øt added in the ≈øea≈øoning. Concerning the Order of the Pre≈øcription, they are to be prepared by the Apothecary, as they are pre≈øcribed by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øician, <hi>viz.</hi> fir≈øt Roots, then Barks and Woods, if any be added; ≈øecondly, Leaves; thirdly, Seeds; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Fruits; fifthly, Flowers, and with them the Spices la≈øt of all. The Quality of the Liquor is to be varyed, according to the Intention of the Phy≈øician; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Fountain-Water; the Quantity is ≈øeldom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed any other way than by <hi>Q. S.</hi> and is ordered to be boyled to one Pint and an half for Apozems, I u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend it for four Do≈øes. You mu≈øt not pre≈øcribe above twenty Ounces; for they are apt to corrupt. The Quantity of things to be di≈ø≈øolved differs according to the Nature of them. Sweetners are u≈øually di≈ø≈øolved from four Ounces to ≈øix at mo≈øt, ≈øo that every Do≈øe of the Apozem may have between an Ounce, and an Ounce and an half in every Do≈øe: But where Syrup and Sugar are mixed together, the Quantity of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup is mo≈øt commonly about three Ounces, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar pre≈øcribed only with a <hi>Q. S.</hi> Juices and other ≈øtrong Liquors, as Vinegar, Aqua Vitae, and the like, are pre≈øcribed from one Ounce to two Ounces at the mo≈øt. In the aromatizing, or ≈øpicing, two things are to be con≈øidered, the Quality and the Quantity of the Spices: As to the Quality, it is either Spice, yellow or red Sanders, Cinnamon, Ginger, or Saffron: As to the Quantity, one Dram, or a Dram and an half is ≈øufficient.</p>
               <p>In a purging Apozem three things are to be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the Compo≈øition, the U≈øe, and Profit In the Compo≈øition two things are to be regarded, fir≈øt, The Ingredients; ≈øecondly, tho≈øe things that are to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved in it: The Ingredients are ≈øimple Purgers with their Correctives: In the≈øe, three things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, the Quantity, Quality, and Order of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription. In relation to the Quantity, note, that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63575:103"/>tho≈øe purging Simples which are only boyled are the≈øe; Sena, Polypody, Carthamus, Turbith, Hermodactils, Agarick, Epithymum, Hellebore, Spurge, and the Seeds of Dwarf Elder. Tho≈øe which are to be infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed or but very little boyled, are Rhubarb, Myrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, Tamarinds, and ≈øometimes Ca≈ø≈øia. As to the Quantity, it ought to be double to the Quantity they are given in Sub≈øtance, if they are the ≈øtronger Sort; or treble, or quadruple, if they are of the milder Sort, more e≈øpecially, the three following are to be cho≈øen, for the Fundamentals of almo≈øt every purging Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem.</p>
               <q>Take of the Leaves of oriental Sena, the Pith of the Seed of Carthamus, Polypody of the Oak new ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, each two Ounces and an half; you may add, upon occa≈øion, half an Ounce of Gummy Turbith, or half an Ounce of Hermodactyls, or half an Ounce of Agaric trochi≈øcated, or half an Ounce of Rhubarb tyed up in a Rag, or ≈øix Drams of Epithymum, or two Drams of the Roots of black Hellebore, or an Ounce and an half of Tamarinds, or half an Ounce of the Bark of Citron, Myrobalans, or an Ounce of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Orris Roots.</q>
               <p>Things to be di≈ø≈øolved in the ≈øtrained Decoction are Syrups or Electuaries, <hi>viz.</hi> Syrups to four Ounces or ≈øix Ounces, Electuaries to two or three Drams, and ≈øo let an Apozem be made for four Do≈øes.</p>
               <p>A Julep is a fluid Medicine compo≈øed of an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Liquor, and Syrup, or Sugar mixed together without boyling, for four or five Do≈øes, either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, or alter the Humours, or to ≈øtrengthen the Body. In the compo≈øition two things are to be minded, fir≈øt a proper Liquor, of which it is to be made; Secondly, what things are to be di≈ø≈øolved in it. In the Liquor two things are to be regarded, the quality and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: As to the quality, either there is pre≈øcribed a ≈øingle di≈øtilled Water, re≈øpecting the Di≈øea≈øe, and the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63575:103"/>di≈øea≈øed Part, or el≈øe a di≈øtilled Water, and a Juice together, or el≈øe a Decoction: The quantity ought to be about eight Ounces.</p>
               <p>Things to be di≈ø≈øolved are con≈øidered with re≈øpect to their quantity or quality: As to the quality, either Sugar, ≈øome proper Syrup, or Cordial Confection, Pearl, Ivory, or Coral is mixed with it: As to the quantity of Sweetne≈øs, one Ounce, or an Ounce and an half. Confections and Powders are pre≈øcribed from one Scruple to two.</p>
               <p>A Potion is a liquid form of Medicine, made of things proper for Purging, or Cordials; but now a days by a Potion is meant a Purging Potion. The difference of Purging Potions are taken from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Humours they Purge; hence ≈øome are Chola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, ≈øome Phlegmagogues, others Hydragogues, others Melanagogues; and others, compo≈øed of all the≈øe Properties, are called Panchymagogues. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral three things are to be con≈øidered in them; in compo≈øition two things are to be regarded, a proper Liquor whereof it is made, and ≈øuch things as are to be di≈ø≈øolved in it. The Liquor that is fit to di≈ø≈øolve your Medicine for a Purging Potion is to be con≈øidered, as to its quality and quantity: In re≈øpect of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, there is pre≈øcribed either a Decoction or Infu≈øion, or ≈øome other Liquor ≈øerving the intention of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øician. A Decoction of Sena is generally u≈øed, or a Decoction of other Cathartics may be made, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diver≈øity of the Humours, ≈øufficient only for one Do≈øe; and if you di≈ø≈øolve nothing in it, the quantity mu≈øt be the larger. Things to be di≈ø≈øolved are con≈øidered either in quantity or quality. Manna and Ca≈ø≈øia are u≈øed to Purge Choler gently; Rhubarb for Fluxes; Syrups and Electuaries are al≈øo di≈ø≈øolved in it, Syrup of Ro≈øes ≈øolutive, or Diaprunum, or the like. As to the quantity, half an Ounce, or an Ounce of Syrup is u≈øually added, a Dram or two Drams of an
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63575:104"/>Electuary, an Ounce of Manna. A Purging Potion is very u≈øeful for tho≈øe that cannot take Pills or Bolus's.</p>
               <p>An Emul≈øion is an altering Medicine u≈øed to a≈ø≈øwage Pain. In it are to be con≈øidered the Matter, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and the things to be di≈ø≈øolved in it. The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in relation to its quality, are ≈øweet Almonds blanched, the four greater cold Seeds, or white Poppy Seeds, or the like; an Ounce, or an Ounce and an half, or two Ounces of the Matter are generally pre≈øcribed. The Liquor is either fair Water, or a Decoction of Barly, or the like. As to the quantity, a Pint, or thereabout, is pre≈øcribed; for it will not keep long. An Ounce, or an Ounce and an half of Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, or Maiden-hair, is u≈øually mixed with it; ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to make it more plea≈øant, a little Ro≈øe-water is added to it. Three or four Ounces of it is a Do≈øe.</p>
               <p>A Bolus is a form of Medicine, almo≈øt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtence of Honey, or ≈øomewhat thicker. As to the quality of the Matter in general, it is compo≈øed of Purgers, both ≈øimple and compound. As to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in general, a Bolus ought not to exceed ≈øix Drams; Ca≈ø≈øia, or the Pulp of Tamarinds is generally the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it.</p>
               <p>A Linctus is a Medicine of the thickne≈øs of Honey, compounded of pectoral Simples, and is u≈øed for Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes of the Lungs and Brea≈øt: it is u≈øually made of Syrups, Oyl, and Sugar. As take of the Syrups of Jujubes, and Maiden-hair, each one Ounce and an half, of Oyl of ≈øweet Almonds fre≈øh drawn one Ounce, of Sugarcandy two Drams, mix them, by beating them well in a Gla≈øs Mortar till they are White.</p>
               <p>A Linctus is commonly pre≈øcribed to be lickt with a Liquori≈øh Stick. Powders are al≈øo ≈øometimes u≈øed in a Linctus; as to their quantity, they are pre≈øcribed to an Ounce with four times the quantity of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>

               <p>Vomits are ≈øaid to be Medicines which evacuate Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Flegm, and ≈øometimes Poy≈øons from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and neighbouring Parts.

               <p>Salt of Vitriol is much valued, becau≈øe it ≈øeldom cau≈øes any di≈øturbance beyond the Stomach, whereas Stybiats ≈øometimes occa≈øion Convul≈øions of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and Faintings, yet it works dully, and ≈øometimes not at all; wherefore upon taking of Salt of Vitriol, great quantities of Po≈ø≈øet-drink mu≈øt be taken, and it mu≈øt be forced up with a Feather. Pills are a ≈øolid form of Medicine, and round, made of Powders, and ≈øometimes Gums, Juices, tempered with ≈øome Clammy Liquor, chiefly prepared to Purge withall. The mo≈øt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63575:105"/>u≈øual are, the Stomach Pill, <hi>Rudius</hi>'s Pill, Agaric, Cochiae, Aloephangin. foetid. The Matter is generally Aloes, as the Ba≈øis; the Liquor is a Mucilage, or ≈øome proper Syrup. The Do≈øe of ≈øtrong Pills is a Scruple; of moderate, two Scruples, or a Dram; of the gentle one or two Drams.</p>
               <p>The Liquor of a Purging Gli≈øter is the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. The Liquor of an altering Gli≈øter is made of mollifying things, heating or cooling, according to the intention. As to the quantity of the Liquor, it varies according to the Age of the Party very much; for three Ounces will ≈øerve for a Child of Four or Five Months old. A Pint is commonly pre≈øcribed for the Adult. Great Men will receive a Pint and an half; but it is to be noted, that for Women with Child, and tho≈øe that have a Drop≈øie, or are troubled with Wind; and for Old Folks, three quarters of a Pint will be ≈øufficient, when we would have the Gly≈øter long kept in the Body: The things to be di≈ø≈øolved are either Alterers or Purgers; the Alterers which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally di≈ø≈øolved, are Honey, Sugar, and Oyl. Salt is ≈øometimes added, when we de≈øign to make the Gly≈øter more provocative. The Purgers are Electuaries, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lenifying or Purging, according to the variety of the Humour to be Purged, and the Con≈øtitution of the Body.</p>
               <p>A Medicinal Wine, is Wine impregnated with the Vertues of divers Simples infu≈øed in it to alter the Humours, or Purge: In the compo≈øition three things are to be ob≈øerved, the Wine, the Things to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed in it, and the Things that are ≈øometimes di≈ø≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it. A Purging Medicinal Wine is impregnated with the Vertues of divers Purging Simples. As to the quality of the Wine, it is either new and unclean≈øed, or el≈øe Wine clean≈øed from the Lees; in relation to the quantity, that mu≈øt be limited with re≈øpect to the U≈øe and Do≈øe. But I u≈øually define the quantity of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63575:105"/>Wine, and Things to be infu≈øed in it thus: A Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine that is to be pre≈øcribed is to be u≈øed twelve days, either together, or every other day, wherein you mu≈øt be ≈øure to have twelve ≈øeveral Do≈øes of the Purgers with their Correctors, and if it be needful, ≈øit Alterers; then mu≈øt you compute the quantity of them all. For in≈øtance, ≈øuppo≈øe them eight Ounces: Now if you would have the Do≈øe of the Wine to be about an Ounce and an half, or two Ounces, pre≈øcribe it to three times their weight, and ≈øo for other quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities as you plea≈øe; by the ≈øame way, you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as you ≈øee fit. But if the Wine be purely Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made of the gentler ≈øort of Cathartics, it is to be taken four, five, or ≈øix times, at due di≈øtances. The things to be infu≈øed, in re≈øpect of their quality, are either Purges only with their Correctors, or el≈øe with them are al≈øo infu≈øed divers Alterers dryed, as Woods, Roots, Barks, Leaves, Seeds, Flowers, Spices.</p>
               <p>In relation to the quantity, the number of Do≈øes for which the Wine is Prepared, ≈øhall direct you. For in≈øtance, a Wine of Sena is de≈øired for twenty Do≈øes. Now the Do≈øe of Sena in infu≈øion is half an Ounce, or ≈øix Drams, therefore ten Ounces, or fifteen of it, is to be pre≈øcribed. If the Wine be prepared of many Purgers, both gentle and ≈øtrong, and al≈øo Alterers joined with them; this proportion is for the mo≈øt part to be generally ob≈øerved. Of the gentle ≈øort let there be one part, of the ≈øtronger ≈øort a quarter ≈øo much; of Correctors a quarter ≈øo much as of Purgers; Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ≈øhould be half ≈øo much as the Purgers. Things that are to be di≈ø≈øolved in re≈øpect of their quality, are either Sugar, or Spices. As to their quantity, for every Pint of Purging Wine, you may add three or four Ounces of Sugar, and two Drams of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>Medicinal Wines are u≈øually pre≈øcribed for long, and cold Di≈øea≈øes, e≈øpecially in the Winter-time.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:63575:106"/>
               <p>Medicinal altering Wines are u≈øed with re≈øpect to certain parts, as Sage Wine for cold Affections of the Brain, Hy≈ø≈øop and Elecampane Wine for the Brea≈øt, Wormwood Wine for the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Medicinal Wines are al≈øo pre≈øcribed again≈øt the Stone, to provoke Urine and the Cour≈øes. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition is the ≈øame with that of the Purging Wine.</p>
               <p>A Gargari≈øm is a liquid Medicine pre≈øcribed for Di≈øea≈øes of the Mouth, Gums and Throat. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Waters, and proper things to be di≈ø≈øolved in it. As to the quantity, a Pint, or a Pint and an half of Water is pre≈øcribed. Of the things to be di≈ø≈øolved in it, namely Syrups, 3 or 4 Ounces; of Honey 1 Ounce and an half, or 2 Ounces; of Vinegar 2 or 3 Ounces.</p>
               <p>A Pe≈ø≈øary is a Medicine to be put up a Womans Privities in many Di≈øea≈øes of the Womb.

               <p>Note, that ≈øome Powders may be added to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, either ≈øharp hy≈øterical opening Powders to a Dram and an half, or two Drams, or el≈øe Powders of Purgers ≈øimple, or compound, to two Drams.</p>
               <p>A Suppo≈øitory is a topical Medicine u≈øed to the Fundament, or <hi>Anus,</hi> three or four Inches in length, ≈ølender and round; it is either ≈øimple or compound. The ≈øimple is made either of the ≈øtalk or root of Beets, Colewort, or Mar≈øhmallows; the outward Peel being taken off, to which is added ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Salt, (to augment the provocative Vertue) rub'd on the out≈øide, ≈ømoothen'd over with Oyl; al≈øo the ≈øtalk of a Leek anointed with Butter; or white Soap ≈øharpened like a Suppo≈øitory; al≈øo Honey alone boiled to a hard con≈øi≈øtence, for ≈øo it becomes more ≈øharp.</p>
               <p>The Compound is made of Honey as the Ba≈øis, boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till it will not ≈øtick to the Fingers, then adding Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63575:106"/>to it near to this proportion: As to one Ounce you may add one Dram, or four Scruples of Powder at mo≈øt, according as the Powder is lighter in weight, or ≈øtronger in operation; which quantity will ≈øerve for two or three Suppo≈øitories.</p>
               <p>A Catapla≈øm is a ≈øo≈øt Topick; it is compounded variou≈øly, either, which is mo≈øt u≈øual of the Mucilage of divers parts of Plants, to which are after added, either Oyls alone, or with Powders.

The Powders in relation to their quality are Flower of Barly, Beans, Lin≈øeed, Fenugreek Seed; or to di≈øcu≈øs, Orris, Cumin, Camomile Flowers, and the like; or ≈øometimes Fruits, ripe, or unripe, as Apples, Prunes, Quinces, and the like, roa≈øted under the Embers, or boiled in a fit Liquor, and brui≈øed, adding fit Powders in the quantity afore≈øaid; as in the Flux of the Belly, and Dy≈øentery, it is made of the Pulp of Quinces and a≈øtringent Powders; or ≈øometimes in Fluxes of the Belly, Vomiting, and to ≈øtrengthen the Stomach, a ≈ølice of Bread ≈øteeped in Wine, and toa≈øted hot, is pre≈øcribed, being ≈øprinkled with one or two Ounces of an a≈øtringent ≈øtrengthning Powder, to be applied to the Stomach.</p>
               <p>A Catapla≈øm for Pain is made of Crums of White Bread ≈øteeped in half a Pint of Milk; to which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two Yolks of Eggs, half an Ounce of Saffron, and q. s. of Oyl fit for the purpo≈øe. Catapla≈øms are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied chiefly to ea≈øe Pain, to ≈øoften hard Swellings, to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63575:107"/>ripen Tumours, and to di≈ø≈øolve the Cau≈øe of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. They are u≈øually pre≈øcribed of a≈øtringent Things, to ≈øtop Fluxes, and are profitably made to provoke Urine; of Pellitory of the Wall, and Oyl of Scorpions, applied to the bottom of the Belly; for they relax, mollify, and empty powerfully.</p>
               <p>A Pulti≈øs differs from a Catapla≈øm in nothing el≈øe, ≈øaving that that is prepared of the Mucilage of Things boiled to Pap, and this is u≈øually made of the flowery part of Things boiled to the con≈øi≈øtence of a Pulti≈øs. It is either compounded of the Flower of Pul≈øe, four Ounces being boiled in a convenient Liquor, to which afterwards are added Oyls, or three or four Ounces of Grea≈øe, or ≈øome other thing equivalent to Oyl, if the ca≈øe ≈øo requires, or of the Crums of White Bread to ea≈øe Pain, and ripen; or of a convenient Mucilage and Powders, and Oyls. But this is rather a Catapla≈øm.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of the Office of a Phy≈øician.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is no part of a Phy≈øician's Office more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrious than Con≈øultation; becau≈øe by it alone unlearned Phy≈øicians are di≈øtingui≈øhed from the learned; and there is nothing that brings greater advantage to the Sick; but Care mu≈øt be taken that Differences do not ari≈øe out of Hatred, or private Intere≈øt. We may indeed ≈øometimes oppo≈øe other Mens Opinions, if they ≈øeem not good, but re≈øpect mu≈øt be always had to the Laws of Rea≈øon and Experience, and we mu≈øt ≈øubmit always to the Judgment of the mo≈øt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, and to Plurality. The≈øe Con≈øultations mu≈øt be held apart from the Patients, to the end every Man may more freely di≈øcover his Fears or Hopes; for Fear is not ea≈øily removed out of the Patient's Head, when
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63575:107"/>he is once po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with it. Be≈øides, if any one of the Phy≈øicians have a Spark of Vain-glory in him, he will be apt to magnifie him≈øelf before the Patient.</p>
               <p>A faithful and true Account of the Di≈øea≈øes, their Cau≈øes and Symptoms mu≈øt be required of the Patient; for <hi>Cel≈øus</hi> ≈øays, that many die thro' their own Fault, e≈øpecially Women, when their Mode≈øty will not allow them to reveal the ≈øecret Di≈øea≈øes of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>We mu≈øt not utterly deny a Patient all Remedies, how de≈øperate ≈øoever his Ca≈øe is; for the Strength of Nature is admirable, and ≈øhe often rallies again≈øt the triumphant Enemy, and ≈øometimes in a fre≈øh Combate becomes victorious. Now, ≈øince it is ≈øo, and ≈øince of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ≈øuch unexpected Events have convinced us, that as long as there is Life there may be Hopes, we ought to be doing ≈øomething: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> him≈øelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that Predictions of Life and Death are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways certain.</p>
               <p>Let the Phy≈øician be doubtful in his Progno≈øtic, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs there be mo≈øt certain, and infallible Signs of Death; Let him be moderate in his Promi≈øes, yet let him give always Hopes rather of Health, than foretel certain Death; for when the Patient is given over by the Phy≈øician, if he recover afterwards (as he often does, which occa≈øioned the Proverb, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is better to be condemned twice by the Phy≈øician, than once by the Judge) the Phy≈øician incurs Infamy.</p>
               <p>In ≈øome Di≈øea≈øes, great regard mu≈øt be had to Mens way of living, otherwi≈øe they will be hardly cured; and ≈øo many good and admirable Cures have been performed.</p>
               <p>Let neither the Phy≈øician, nor the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry declare what their Medicines are, either to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or to the By-≈øtanders; let them only ≈øignifie, that they intend to give a Purge, a Vomit, or a Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, and conceal what the≈øe are made of, both becau≈øe otherwi≈øe they may be improperly taken, without the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63575:108"/>Advice of a Phy≈øician, or becau≈øe when things are known, they are contemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> bids us ob≈øerve all the Patient's Errors, whether about Meat or Drink, or about Medicines, or external things; for if through their own Faults they grow wor≈øe, the Blame is laid upon the Ph≈øici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
               <p>We mu≈øt not u≈øe Medicines, but upon urgent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity; for ≈øometimes we mu≈øt re≈øt a while, and do nothing but order a good Diet.</p>
               <p>It is not unbecoming a Phy≈øician, who is skill'd in the manual Operation, to breath a Vein, when there is no Surgeon to do it, or to ≈øet a Limb that is broken or out of joint; for a Surgeon's Work is one of the three Parts of Phy≈øick; nor is it di≈øgraceful to make up Medicines: And indeed it were well if Phy≈øicians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed them≈øelves more to Pharmacy than they do.</p>
               <p>Let the Phy≈øician never pre≈øcribe two Medicines at once, and leave the Patient to his Choice, becau≈øe then he is at a Lo≈øs, and can tru≈øt neither of them, but blames his Phy≈øician for Incon≈øtancy.</p>
               <p>A Phy≈øician ought not always to contemn the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of the common People. Let no Man, ≈øays <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> be a≈øhamed, if he be never ≈øo learned, to learn ≈øomething that conduces to the Perfection of his Art, tho from an old Woman.</p>
               <p>A Phy≈øician mu≈øt not mix tho≈øe things which de≈øtroy one another by a manife≈øt Contrariety; for example, vitriolated things mu≈øt not be mixed with nitrous ones, nor aluminous things with Alcalies, and the like.</p>
               <p>Some counterfeit Di≈øea≈øes, who≈øe Deceit it belongs to a prudent Phy≈øician to detect; now the Di≈øea≈øes that are counterfeited, are u≈øually Swooning, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, Fits of the Mother. Some tye their Arms ≈øo ≈øtrait, that the Pul≈øe can ≈øcarce, if at all be felt; when they are called on aloud, they do not an≈øwer; if they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63575:108"/>be prickt a little, or their Ears pull'd, or their Fingers bent, they bear it patiently. The Cheat is di≈øcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by asking, whether any Want of Food has preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Lo≈øs of Blood, a Loo≈øne≈øs, Vomiting, or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sweating, or any Di≈øea≈øe; or whether he hath been in a hot Place, or where Coals have been kindled in a clo≈øe Room, or whether he hath been put in ≈øome great Pa≈ø≈øion. But if the extream Parts are cold, and if a cold Sweat bur≈øt out, e≈øpecially about the Head, Face, and Neck; if the Pul≈øe cannot be felt, or are creeping; if the Breathing be little and cold, if the Colour of the Face be gone, and if he void his Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the≈øe ≈øignifie that the Di≈øea≈øes are not feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But if there be no ≈øuch Signs, and if the Cheater ≈øhuts his Eyes, and looks as if he were in a Swoon, the Phy≈øician mu≈øt mention ≈øome ≈øtrong Medicines, he mu≈øt order burning, bending of the Fingers, and pricking of the Body with Needles; for by this means the Cheat may be di≈øcovered. Some rai≈øe Bli≈øters, Swellings, and Ulcers, by wa≈øhing the Skin with the Juice of Spurge, or with a Decoction of <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Flies, or Wa≈øps, in Water, or by applying ≈øcorching Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, or Turbith, or Powder of Rue: It is u≈øual with Beggars to move Compa≈ø≈øion, but the Cheat may be ea≈øily di≈øcovered, by applying Populeon Oyntment, or the like; becau≈øe Bli≈øters and Swellings occa≈øioned by ≈øuch Applications may be ea≈øily cured thereby. Some counterfeit Madne≈øs; but you may di≈øcover them by their Habit, and by the Ab≈øence of the Signs of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, or Melancholy. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>li≈ø≈øes</hi>'s feigned Madne≈øs was di≈øcovered by throwing his Son before the Plow; for he lifted the Plow over him. Some, with the Steem of Brim≈øtone, or with ≈øome ≈øuch thing, di≈øcolour the Face; Saffron or Rhubarb does the ≈øame. Tho≈øe that counterfeit Pains may be ea≈øily di≈øcovered, for they bear it better, and do not change Po≈øtures, as tho≈øe do that are in violent Pain. Be≈øides, they that are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63575:109"/>ill of a Di≈øea≈øe are willing to admit of any Remedy voluntarily, ≈øend for Phy≈øicians, and do whatever they pre≈øcribe. But if they be but a little ≈øick, or not at all, they refu≈øe ≈øuch Remedies. Sometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that a wounded Man, either out of Hatred to him that wounded him, or to get ≈øome Money out of him, feigns that ≈øome Limb is hurt: In this Ca≈øe you mu≈øt touch that Hand or Limb unawares.</p>
               <p>When a Phy≈øician is fir≈øt called to a Patient, after he has put the Patient in Hopes of Recovery, let him order ≈øomething pre≈øently, that he may not be thought to practi≈øe Phy≈øick by Books, e≈øpecially when he is called after other Phy≈øicians; for then all expect ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than others have done before; therefore when you are informed what they have done, begin ≈øome other Method, yet ≈øuch as you think is more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, le≈øt if you ≈øhould repeat the ≈øame things, they ≈øhould think you were called to no purpo≈øe. If the Di≈øea≈øe be ≈øuch as may be cured by Diet alone, yet you mu≈øt pre≈øcribe ≈øome Phy≈øick, which may do no Hurt, or ≈øomething like Diet, which may do Good, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øay you were ignorant, and affirm that Nature cured the Di≈øea≈øe. This mu≈øt be e≈øpecially done when the Patient never thinks him≈øelf ≈øafe or well, but when he is taking Phy≈øick; and if you do not trifle with him in this manner, he will find others that will tamper with him and ≈øpoil him.</p>
               <p>A Phy≈øician ≈øhould never vi≈øit the ≈øick, unle≈øs he be ≈øent for, and his Vi≈øits ought not to be too frequent, when he is entertained.</p>
               <p>There are ≈øome principal things, concerning which Patients ≈øhould be interrogated, fir≈øt, what it is that ails him, and how his Head and Stomach, and other principal Parts do; how many Days he has been ill; what made him ill, what Diet he kept; whether he be loo≈øe or co≈øtive; whether he u≈øed naturally to breed bad Humours; whether any natural Evacuation be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63575:109"/>≈øtopt; whether he be u≈øed to labour, or a ≈øedentary Life.</p>
               <p>Patients mu≈øt not always be ≈øeverely denied what Nature earne≈øtly craves for, for we ≈øee that ≈øeveral do not recover till their Appetites are gratified.</p>
               <p>You mu≈øt vary the Cour≈øe of Diet and Medicines, according to the Con≈øtitutions, Climates, Situation of Countries.</p>
               <p>There are many things in this Art, wherein for Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency's Sake, it is a piece of Art to depart from Art; for tho there be many good Precepts and Rules, yet none are perpetual, and he that reckons any for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and inviolable, may be a Methodi≈øt, but not at all rational; for a rational Phy≈øician proceeds not ≈øo much by Book as by Experience; for in Ca≈øes there is a wonderful Variety.</p>
               <p>When the Phy≈øician judges ≈øome generous Remedy requi≈øite, and the Ratient or By-≈øtanders are again≈øt it, he ought to acquaint them with the pre≈øent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Mi≈øchief of deferring it, and the Damage that will follow; thus they that will not yield to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions, will ≈øometimes obey for Fear of future Evil.</p>
               <p>It is much better to be an empirical Phy≈øician, that is, one who practi≈øes according to Experience, than a theorical one, who practi≈øes according to his own Rea≈øonings and Figments; for Experience has long ≈øince informed all accurate Ob≈øervers of things, which happen in our Art, that Empiricks are more ≈øuccesful in their Practice than Theori≈øts, and ≈øuch as are Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicians from Books, or their own Speculations: The≈øe are ≈øo much more mi≈øerable in their Folly, becau≈øe they make others mi≈øerable with them≈øelves; but the World will be bubled with cramp Words, and great Brags.</p>
               <p>It is unbecoming a Phy≈øician to harangue to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanders; for it gives the Patient a Su≈øpicion that he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63575:110"/>would cure indeed, but that he is not able, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would ≈øupply in Talk what he cannot perform by his Skill.</p>
               <p>It is the Part of a Phy≈øician, not only to u≈øe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and to order the Meat and Drink, but al≈øo to take care of all things that mu≈øt be done or ≈øaid before the Patient, and of the Chamber, Hou≈øe and Bed, and of all external things, and to di≈øpo≈øe of them all, ≈øo as they may be mo≈øt for the Benefit of the Patient.</p>
               <p>When the Nature of the Di≈øea≈øe is ob≈øcure, yet as for the Cure, an Indication is left us, to be taken from the <hi>Juvantia &amp; Laedentia,</hi> by means whereof, trying the way by degrees, we may conduct the Patient, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we make not too much Ha≈øte, than which nothing is more de≈øtructive. I am not a≈øhamed, ≈øays <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to confe≈øs, that when I was not ≈øatisfied what I ought to do, I provided be≈øt for my Patient and my ≈øelf by doing nothing; for while I waited for an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, the Di≈øea≈øe either went off of it ≈øelf, or put on ≈øuch a Type, as I knew well enough how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. And indeed, more ≈øhould be left to Nature than is now the Cu≈øtom to do; for he is much mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, who thinks Nature always needs the Help of Art; for if it were ≈øo, ≈øhe has not taken that Care of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kind, which the Con≈øervation of the Species re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, ≈øeeing there has been no Proportion between the Frequency of Di≈øea≈øes that invade Man, and their Faculties which Men have to drive them away, even in the≈øe Ages, when Phy≈øick flouri≈øhed mo≈øt, and when mo≈øt Men practi≈øed it.</p>
               <p>It is found by Experience, that every ≈øeven or nine Years a Man undergoes ≈øome great Alteration; the≈øe are called Climacteric, becau≈øe they are Steps or Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whereby we climb up to old Age: In the≈øe Years therefore no great Medicines mu≈øt be u≈øed, and becau≈øe then Nature u≈øes to do ≈øome great thing, the Phy≈øician mu≈øt be quiet.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:63575:110"/>
               <p>Many Phy≈øicians avoid all Days of Oppo≈øitions and Conjunctions of the Moon, unnece≈ø≈øarily; for all the Phy≈øician has to do, is to ob≈øerve the Alterations of the Air.</p>

               <p>THE Lungs of a Lamb, as well as tho≈øe of a Fox, are commended for Con≈øumptions, and Di≈øea≈øes of the Lungs. The coagulated Milk of a Sheep or Goat is excellent for di≈ø≈øolving Womens coagulated Milk.</p>
               <p>The Horns and Hoof of an Elk are in U≈øe, and both are accounted Specifics for an Epilep≈øie, Convul≈øions, Tremblings of the Limbs, Giddine≈øs, Palpitation of the Heart, and hy≈øteric Fits.</p>
               <p>The Tooth of a Boar is reckoned a Specific in Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øies and Quin≈øies; half a Dram or a Dram of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, being given in a Decoction of the Flowers of red Poppies, or in a Decoction of Carduus Benedictus. Some give a Dram of the Ra≈øpings of it, mixed with Oyl of Almonds and Sugarcandy: But the Ra≈øpings of it mixed with a Decoction is be≈øt; for it yields a kind of a Gelly. The Stones are a Specific for Barrenne≈øs in Women, and an E≈ø≈øence is prepared of them, which is counted good for Impotents, and it is u≈øed al≈øo to promote and ≈øtimulate Venery. The Dung is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an excellent Specific to ≈øtop Blood. The Urine is good for the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder.</p>
               <p>Of the Blood of an A≈øs is prepared an E≈ø≈øence, which is reckoned good for the Falling-≈øickne≈øs. The Filth of an A≈ø≈øes Ear promotes Sleep, being applied to the Temples, and is excellent in malignant Fevers,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63575:111"/>but you mu≈øt not anoint the Temples with it too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, le≈øt it make the Patient ≈øleep too much. A≈ø≈øes Milk nouri≈øhes much, loo≈øens the Belly, and provokes Urine, and is much commended for a Con≈øumption, the Stone in the Bladder, and in the Kidneys; and is better in the≈øe Ca≈øes than any other ≈øort of Milk what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, three Quarters of a Pint of it being drank five or ≈øix Mornings, ≈øweetned with an Ounce of Sugarcandy, and the Patient mu≈øt fa≈øt three Hours after; he mu≈øt al≈øo take the ≈øame Quantity three Hours before Supper: But in this Cour≈øe he mu≈øt ab≈øtain from all acid Meats. A≈ø≈øes Milk is al≈øo good for the Gout.</p>
               <p>A≈ø≈øes Dung gathered in <hi>May,</hi> is good for bleeding at the No≈øe, or for Blood flowing from any other Part, a Dram being taken at a time. The Fume of the Dung is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo good for bleeding at the No≈øe, and for too great a Flux of the Cour≈øes. Or,
<q>Take of Plantain Water one Ounce, of Syrup of Myrtles, and of the Juice of A≈ø≈øes Dung, each half a Dram; mix them: This Potion taken in the Morning, and continued for ≈øome Days, is an approved Remedy for all Fluxes of the Womb, whether white or red, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øals going before.</q>

               <p>The Reins of an A≈øs powdered, and mixed with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and drank in Beer, are an excellent Remedy for the Strangury. The hard Fle≈øh growing about the Knees of an A≈øs is reckoned as a great Secret for the making Hair to grow.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63575:111"/>or Oyntment made of Aloes, Cow's Gaul, Myrrh, and Oyl of Coloquintida, and applied to the Navel, is much commended to expel Worms in grown People, and in Children. The Gaul of all Sorts of Animals is much commended for Di≈øea≈øes of the Ears, to quiet the Noi≈øe, to remove Deafne≈øs and Dullne≈øs of hearing, being put into the Ear with Cotton. The Spleen of a Cow is much commended for Di≈øea≈øes of the Spleen, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hardne≈øs, Inflation, Pain, and Swelling of it. It is al≈øo good for Ob≈øtructions of the Cour≈øes, and for the Cachexy of Virgins ari≈øing thence, for which it is much commended.</p>
               <p>Cow's Marrow is frequently u≈øed for Di≈øea≈øes of the Nerves; Cow's Dung is frequently u≈øed for Burns, in the manner of a Catapla≈øm, and for Inflammations, and being applied to the Belly, it is an excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the Cholick, and to expel Wind. It is al≈øo applied to the Belly in Drop≈øies, to le≈ø≈øen the Swelling, and to di≈øcu≈øs the Water. It is al≈øo u≈øed for flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Swellings of the Parts. It ≈øtops Inflammations, and prevents Gangrens. The Water of the Dung, called the Water of all the Flowers, is an excellent Co≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic, and takes off Spots from the Face. It is al≈øo much commended for provoking Urine, and expelling Gravel. Some ordinary People pre≈øs out the Juice of the Dung, and drink it for the Cholick and Pleuri≈øie, and it is counted a pre≈øent Remedy.</p>
               <p>There is often found in the Stomach of a Cow or Bull, a Stone, which is ≈øometimes pretty large, and ≈øometimes a Stone in the Gaul-bladder, the Powder whereof, e≈øpecially of that Stone in the Gaul-Bladder, is counted an excellent Remedy for the Jaundice, and to expel Gravel; it al≈øo expels Poi≈øons by Sweat, and drives away the Fits of the Falling-≈øickne≈øs.

               <p>The Milk of a Cow, as all other Milk does, con≈øi≈øts of three Sub≈øtances, Whey, Butter, and Chee≈øe; it is an excellent Nouri≈øhment, and partakes much of the Nature of the Herb the Bea≈øts feed on; and ≈øo if they feed on Water-cre≈øs, Brook-lime, Scurvy-gra≈øs, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-wort, and the like, the Milk will be good for the Scurvy; and if they eat Ground-Ivy, and the like, the Milk will be proper for a Con≈øumption, and Ulcers in the inner Parts.</p>

But in the U≈øe of it, acid things mu≈øt be avoided, and to hinder its Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it is convenient to mix a little Sugar with it; for Sugar powerfully hinders the Coagulation, and if a little of it be mixed with it, Butter or Chee≈øe can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made.</p>
               <p>But Milk is naught for ≈øuch as have continual or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fevers.

They are mo≈øt commonly u≈øed to rai≈øe Bli≈øters, their Wings and Heads being plucked off. Some mix five or ≈øix with an Ounce, or an Ounce and an half of Leaven, and half an Ounce of the Pulp of Figs; others take a Dram and an half, or two Drams of Cantharides, and mix them with the Crum of Rye Bread, and moi≈øten it with ≈øome proper Water; when you would have a more powerful Bli≈øtring Pla≈øter, mix Mu≈øtard Seed with them. Some think that Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or Leaven, le≈ø≈øens the Vertue of the Cantharides, but I have ob≈øerved the contrary. Some prepare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent Ve≈øicatories with Cantharides, Myrrh, and Ma≈øtick. Some prepare Cantharides with a ≈øufficient quantity of Wine, and u≈øe them inwardly for the Gout. Wenches u≈øe them to cau≈øe Abortion, but not without great danger. An Old Man that married a young Wife, took Cantharides to make him Vigorous, but he died the next day after his Marriage. The Oyl

You may make the Spirit in the following manner: Put a piece of Chee≈øe into a Cucur bit, and thru≈øt the Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit into a Hill of Ants, and they will be allured by the Chee≈øe to run in; when you have got enough, take out the Chee≈øe, and pour in Spirit of Wine three Fingers above them, di≈øtill it, and add new Ants to the Wine, and ≈øo by cohobating often, you will have a good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

Ants Eggs brui≈øed, and an Oyl prepared of them, are much commended for dullne≈øs of hearing: But the Eggs are not to be taken inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for they generate abundance of Wind. A heap of Ants boiled in Water, is an excellent Bath for Di≈øea≈øes of the Nerves and Mu≈øcles, and for a Pal≈øy, and the Gout. It al≈øo cures Barrenne≈øs and the Hip-Gout. The Oyl of Ants made by Infu≈øion provokes Venery, the Penis, Te≈øticles, and the Mu≈øcles that erect the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, being anointed.</p>

               <p>Put wa≈øhed Worms into a Cucurbit ≈øo well ≈øtopped, that nothing can exhale. Place the Cucurbit to dige≈øt, either in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> or in the Heat of the Sun, that the Worms may putrify and ferment; and this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is ≈øometimes ≈øo very great, that it breaks the Gla≈øs. The Fermentation being over, the Earthy Part ≈øinks to the bottom, and the Skins ≈øwim on the top, the ≈øpirituous Liquor is in the middle. Separate this, and di≈øtill it, and it will yield a Spirit; this Spirit is an excellent Diuretic.</p>
               <p>The Decoction of Worms is much commended by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> for the bloody Flux. The Powder of Worms is good for the Jaundice, ≈øo is the Decoction of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, with the greater Celandine, e≈øpecially if ≈øome Juniper-berries be added to it. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms boyled with Aperitive Plants, are very good in many Di≈øea≈øes, by rea≈øon of their penetrating, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Diuretick Faculty; and are therefore very good for Di≈øea≈øes of the Spleen, and the Drop≈øy. The Powder of Worms is very good to increa≈øe Milk, a Dram of it being taken at a time alone, or with Fennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeed.

               <p>Turbith Mineral is a Mercury impregnated with the Acidity of Oyl of Vitriol. It purges ≈øtrongly both by Vomit and Stool, and is an excellent Remedy in vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Di≈øea≈øes. The Do≈øe is from two Grains to ≈øix.</p>
               <p>Antimony is a Mineral con≈øi≈øting of a Sulphur, like unto common Sulphur. It is found in many Places in <hi>Tran≈øylvania, Hungary, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> You mu≈øt chu≈øe that which is in long ≈øhining Needles, and not expect to find it of a reddi≈øh Colour, as many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors advi≈øe; for in an hundred Weight of this Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, you'll hardly find one Piece of this Kind. Crude Antimony is u≈øed in ≈øudorific Decoctions, when we would di≈ø≈øipate a Tumour by Tran≈øpiration: But great care mu≈øt be had that no Acid enter into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction; for then it would open its Body, and make it emetic. It is al≈øo dangerous to take it in Sub≈øtance, becau≈øe it may be apt to meet with an Acid in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that would open its Body, and thereby cau≈øe a vomiting.</p>
               <p>Gla≈øs of Antimony is a Regulus of Antimony vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by long Fu≈øion. It is a ≈øtrong Vomit, and one of the mo≈øt violent that is made of Antimony.</p>
               <p>An emetic Syrup is prepared with the Gla≈øs of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony infu≈øed in the Juice of Quinces, or Lemons and Sugar.</p>
               <p>Liver of Antimony is Antimony opened by Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and by Fire, which have made it half Gla≈øs, and given it a Liver Colour. To make the emetic Wine,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63575:129"/>you mu≈øt infu≈øe an Ounce of this Liver of Antimony powdered in a Quart of White-wine, twenty four Hours, and ≈øo let it ≈øettle. The Do≈øe of this Wine is from half an Ounce to three Ounces.</p>
               <p>Diaphoretic Antimony is an Antimony who≈øe Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs are fixed by Salt-peter, and are thereby hindred from working otherwi≈øe than by Sweat.</p>
               <p>This Preparation is e≈øteemed good to procure Sweat, and to re≈øi≈øt Poy≈øon, and con≈øequently is good in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers, the Small-pox, the Plague, and other contagious Di≈øea≈øes. The Do≈øe is from ≈øix Grains to thirty in ≈øome proper Liquor.</p>
               <p>Bezoar Mineral is an Antimony fixed by Spirit of Niter, and rendred ≈øudorific. It ≈øerves for the ≈øame U≈øes as Diaphoretic Antimony. The Do≈øe is from ≈øix to twenty Grains in ≈øome proper Liquor.</p>
               <p>Ar≈øenick is a Mineral Body, con≈øi≈øting of much Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and ≈øome cau≈øtick Salts. There are three Sorts of it, the white, that keeps the Name of Ar≈øenick, the yellow, called Auripigmentum, and the red called Sandaracha. The white is the ≈øtronge≈øt of all: But none of them mu≈øt be given inwardly, altho' ≈øeveral Per≈øons that have ventured to u≈øe the white, pretend to have cured with it divers Di≈øea≈øes, and among others the Quartan Ague. They venture to give four Grains of it in a great deal of Water, and after that manner it will vomit like Antimony. But it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Medicine, and therefore I think it ought not to be u≈øed inwardly. People ≈øometimes cover the Corns of their Feet with Ar≈øenick in Powder, and it eats them to the Root without any Pain: But they mu≈øt be ≈øure to cover the adjacent Fle≈øh with a Pla≈øter of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma, after the ≈øame manner as when Cau≈øticks are applied.</p>
               <p>Quick-lime is a Stone who≈øe Moi≈øture the Fire has quite dried up, and brought into its Place a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny igneous Bodies. The≈øe little Bodies cau≈øe the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63575:130"/>Ebullition, when Water has opened the Matter that kept them inclo≈øed, and this Ebullition la≈øts until all the Parts of the Lime are dilated, and the fiery Particles ≈øet at Liberty. The≈øe little igneous Bodies render the Lime corro≈øive, for the Stone is not at all ≈øo of it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>Phagadenick Water is made of Sublimate and Lime Water. Put a Pound of quick Lime into a large Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Pan, and quench it with ≈øeven or eight Pints of hot Water. After the Lime has infu≈øed five or ≈øix Hours, and is ≈øunk to the Bottom, pour off the Water by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and filtrate it. To each Pint of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are added fifteen or twenty Grains of Sublimate Corro≈øive in Powder, and the Water pre≈øently turns yellow. They are ≈øtirred together a good while in a Gla≈øs or Marble Mortar; and this Water is u≈øed for clean≈øing old Ulcers. It eats proud Fle≈øh, and is u≈øed for a Gangren, Spirit of Wine being added to it. Lime Water is u≈øed for a Diabetes, and often is applied outwardly to dry up Tumours.</p>
               <p>Flints, as all other Stones, are made by different Salts, or by acid Liquors, which do penetrate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with Earth, which is an Alcaly, ≈øo that from their Mixture there does re≈øult a <hi>Coagulum,</hi> which by little and little hardens by means of the ≈øubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Heat, or petrifie by the Cold. The Tincture of Flints is ≈øaid to be a good Remedy to open Ob≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for the Scurvy, and Hypochondriac Di≈øea≈øes. The Do≈øe is from ten to thirty Drops in ≈øome proper Liquor.</p>
               <p>Of common Salt there are three Sorts; the fo≈ø≈øile Salt, the fountain Salt, and the ≈øea Salt; the fir≈øt is called <hi>Sal Gommae,</hi> by rea≈øon of its Tran≈øparency and Smoothne≈øs, like to a precious Stone: Whole Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are found full of it in <hi>Poland</hi> and other Places. The ≈øecond is drawn by the Evaporation of Waters of ≈øome Fountains; and the la≈øt from Sea Water by Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtallization
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63575:130"/>or Evaporation. Spirit of Salt is u≈øed in Juleps for ≈øuch as are ≈øubject to Gravel; it likewi≈øe clean≈øes the Teeth.</p>
               <p>Niter is a Salt impregnated with Abundance of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits out of the Air, which render it volatile: It is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from among the Stones and Earth of old ruined buildings, and in Cellars. <hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> is commonly u≈øed in Phy≈øick, and is counted better than purified Salt-peter, becau≈øe the Sulphur is thought to have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected it. It is given to cool, and to work by Urine in burning Fevers, Quin≈øies, Gonorrhea's, and other Di≈øea≈øes that proceed from Heat and Ob≈øtructions. The Do≈øe is from ten Grains to a Dram in Broath, or ≈øome other Liquor proper for the Di≈øea≈øe. Spirit of Niter dulcified is good for the Collick and nephritick Pains, for hy≈øterick Di≈øea≈øes, and for all Ob≈øtructions. Its Do≈øe is from four to eight Drops in Broath or ≈øome other convenient Liquor.</p>
               <p>Sal Armoniac is either natural or artificial. The natural is found in very hot Countries, as in many Parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> near the torrid Zone. It is found upon the Earth that has imbibed the Urine of Animals. The artificial Sal Armoniac is made at <hi>Venice</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Places, with five Parts of Urine, one Part of Sea Salt, and half a Part of Chimney Soot. The≈øe three are boyled together, and reduced into a Ma≈øs, which being put into ≈øubliming Pots over a gradual Fire, ≈øublimes into Salt, in the Form we commonly ≈øee Sal Armoniac. If you would purify Sal Armoniac, you mu≈øt di≈ø≈øolve it in a ≈øufficient Quantity of Water; filtrate the Di≈ø≈øolution, and evaporate it, until it is dry, in a Gla≈øs Ve≈ø≈øel, you'll have a white Salt, which may be given from ≈øix to four and twenty Grains, in ≈øome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Liquor. It is an excellent Sudorific and Diuretic. It is good in malignant Fevers, and in quartan Agues, and to provoke the Cour≈øes of Women; and is u≈øed in Waters for the Eyes.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:63575:131"/>
               <p>The volatile Spirit of Sal Armoniac, is a volatile Salt rai≈øed from Sal Armoniac, by the means of Quick Lime, and di≈ø≈øolved into a Liquor. This Spirit is an excellent Remedy for all Di≈øea≈øes that proceed from Ob≈øtructions, and Corruption of Humours, ≈øuch as Malignant Fevers, the Falling-≈øickne≈øs, Pal≈øy, Plague, Small-pox, and the like: It drives by Per≈øpiration or by Urine. The Do≈øe is from ≈øix Drops to twenty, in Balm or Carduus Water.</p>
               <p>Volatile Spirit of Sal Armoniac dulcified is a good Medicine for a Lethargy, the Pal≈øy, the Scurvy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers, and hy≈øteric Maladies. It may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in≈øtead of Spirit of Sal Armoniac, and is not ≈øo di≈øagreeable to the Ta≈øte: It works by Sweat, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øible Tran≈øpiration. The Do≈øe is from twelve Drops to fifty in ≈øome proper Liquor. It is likewi≈øe good outwardly applied for the Pal≈øy, and for cold Pains.</p>
               <p>Vitriol is a Mineral compounded of an acid Salt, and ≈øulphureous Earth. There are four Sorts of it, the blew, the white, the green, and the red. The blew is found near the Mines of Copper in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the I≈øle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> from whence it is brought to us in fair Cri≈øtals, which keep the Name of the Country, and are called Vitriol of <hi>Hungary</hi> or <hi>Cyprus.</hi> It par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes very much of the Nature of Copper, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it a little cau≈øtick. It is never u≈øed but in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Applications, ≈øuch as Collyriums, or Waters for the Eyes, and to con≈øume proud Fle≈øh. White Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol is found near Fountains: It is mo≈øt of all depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from a Metallick Mixture. It may be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to give a Vomit. It is likewi≈øe u≈øed in Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riums. There are three Sorts of green Vitriol, the <hi>German,</hi> the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and the <hi>Roman:</hi> That of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> draws near unto the blew, and contains a little Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; it is better than the re≈øt for the Preparation of Aqua Fortis. That of <hi>England</hi> partakes of Iron, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63575:131"/>is proper to make the Spirit of Vitriol. The <hi>Roman</hi> is much like the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Vitriol, excepting that it is not ≈øo ea≈øy to di≈ø≈øolve.</p>
               <p>Red Vitriol was brought among≈øt us a few Years ago out of <hi>Germany.</hi> It is called natural Colcothar, and is e≈øteemed to be a green Vitriol calcined by ≈øome ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Heat. It is the lea≈øt common of them all. It ≈øtops Blood, being applied to Hemorrhagies.</p>
               <p>If you di≈ø≈øolve a little white or green Vitriol in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and write with the Di≈ø≈øolution, the writing will not be ≈øeen; but if you rub the Paper with a little Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton dipt in the Decoction of Gauls, it will appear legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; then if you wet a little more Cotton dipt in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol, and pa≈øs it gently over the Paper, the Ink will di≈øappear again: And yet at la≈øt, if you rub the Place with a little more Cotton dipt in Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> it will again appear legible, but of a yellowi≈øh Colour. The Spirit of Vitriol is u≈øed for continual Fevers, and other Di≈øea≈øes that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a violent Heat. It is al≈øo mixed with Gargari≈øms. Salt of Vitriol is u≈øed to give a Vomit. The Do≈øe is from ten to thirty Grains. This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øafe Vomit for Children and weakly Per≈øons.</p>
               <p>Roch Allom is a very ≈øtyptic Mineral Salt, found in the Veins of the Earth, in many Places of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is taken up in great tran≈øparent Pieces. The be≈øt is that which is reddi≈øh, for the white contains fewer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Allom is purified after the ≈øame manner as Vitriol. It is u≈øed to clean≈øe the Teeth: It is a good Diuretic: A Dram of it is di≈ø≈øolved in a Quart of Water, and a Gla≈øs of it is given now and then. The Di≈øtillation of Allom is u≈øed for Fevers and tertian Agues. The Do≈øe of the Spirit is from four to eight Drops. It is likewi≈øe good to cure the Aphthae or little Chancres in the Mouth. Burnt Allom is u≈øed to eat carnous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre≈øcences, or proud Fle≈øh. If a Dram of Allom be
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63575:132"/>di≈ø≈øolved in ≈øix Ounces of the Flegm of the Di≈øtillation, you make an excellent Allom Water to clean≈øe Wounds and Ulcers with. Surgeons are wont to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine Allom in a Frying-pan, but the Iron dulls the greate≈øt Part of its Virtue, ab≈øorbing its Spirits, wherein con≈øi≈øts the Corro≈øion of Allom.</p>
               <p>Sulphur is a kind of Bitumen that is found in many Places in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> There is brought among≈øt us both a natural and an artificial. The natural is grayi≈øh, and called <hi>Sulphur vivum.</hi> The other is yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and is nothing but the natural melted, purified from its gro≈ø≈øer Earth, and formed into Rolls, which we commonly u≈øe. Some think that Sulphur is a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol ≈øublimed in the Earth, becau≈øe the≈øe Mixts are very often found near one another. That there is a great deal of Sulphur in the Ma≈øs of Mineral Vitriol, and that the acid Spirits which are drawn from both are wholly alike. The Flower of Sulphur is u≈øed in Di≈øea≈øes of the Lungs and Brea≈øt. The Do≈øe is from ten to thirty Grains, in Lozenges, or in an Electuary. It is al≈øo u≈øed in Oyntments for the Itch.</p>
               <p>Magi≈øtery of Sulphur is al≈øo thought good for all Di≈øea≈øes of the Lungs and Brea≈øt. The Do≈øe is from ≈øix to ≈øixteen Grains, in ≈øome convenient Liquor. Bal≈øom of Sulphur is excellent for Ulcers of the Lungs and Brea≈øt. The Do≈øe is from one Drop to ≈øix in ≈øome proper Liquor. This Bal≈øom may be reduced to the Con≈øi≈øtence of an Oyntment, by evaporating ≈øome Part of it, and it is thus u≈øed to clean≈øe Wounds and Ulcers. A Bal≈øom of Sulphur may be made with Oyl of Lin≈øeed, for Wounds. Spirit of Sulphur, which is the acid Part of Sulphur turned into a Liquor with Fire, is put into Juleps to give them an agreeable Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, to qualifie the Heat of continual Fevers, and is a good Diuretic. Some pre≈øcribe it for Di≈øea≈øes of the Brea≈øt. But becau≈øe Acids are apt to cau≈øe a Cough, it may therefore do more Hurt than Good to that Part;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63575:132"/>for the Spirit is deprived of the Fat and Sulphureous Part of the Sulphur, and ≈øo has lo≈øt the Virtue that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Sulphur.</p>
               <p>The Salt of Sulphur is a good Medicine to open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions, and to work by Urine, and ≈øometimes it works al≈øo by Stool. The Do≈øe is from ten Grains to two Scruples in Broath. It is di≈ø≈øolved from half a Dram to Drams, in a Quart of Water, for a Drink in Fevers, and it is indeed good in continual Fevers, and in Tertians, and on all Occa≈øions, where there is need of calming too great a Motion of the Humours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Acid ≈øerves to fix the volatile Salts or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, which are mo≈øt commonly the principal Cau≈øe of the≈øe Di≈øea≈øes.</p>
               <p>There is found in ≈ømall Currents, near the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, in the Dutchy of <hi>Pru≈ø≈øia,</hi> a certain coagulated Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen, which is called Ambar. This Bitumen being ≈øoft and vi≈øcous, ≈øeveral little Animals, ≈øuch as Flies and Ants, do ≈øtick to it, and are buried in it. Ambar is of different Colours, white, yellow, and black. The white is mo≈øt e≈øteemed, tho' it be no better than the yellow. The black has the lea≈øt Virtue of all. Ambar ≈øerves to ≈øtop ≈øpitting of Blood, the Bloody-Flux, the immoderate Flux of the Hemorrhoids, the Cour≈øes, and a Gonorrhea. The Do≈øe is from ten Grains to half a Dram. It is likewi≈øe u≈øed to ≈øtop a little the Violence of Catarrhs, by receiving the Fume of it at the No≈øe. Tincture of Ambar is good for the Apoplexy, Pal≈øy, Epilep≈øy, and for hy≈øteric Women. The Do≈øe is from ten Drops to a Dram in ≈øome proper Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. The white Oyl of Ambar, which ≈øwims above the Spirit and Flegm, after Di≈øtillation is given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in hy≈øteric Di≈øtempers, for the Pal≈øy, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, and Epilep≈øy. The Do≈øe is from one Drop to four in ≈øome proper Liquor. It may be mixed with a little Yolk of an Egg, to di≈ø≈øolve it ea≈øily in Water or Broath. The VVater and Spirit remain mixed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øedly,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63575:133"/>after Di≈øtillation; now to ≈øeparate them, you mu≈øt pour this Mixture into an Earthen or Gla≈øs Di≈øh, and evaporate over a very gentle Fire two Thirds of it; that which remains is the Spirit of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar. Keep it in a Viol well ≈øtopt. It is an excellent Aperitive, and is given in the Jaundice, Stoppage of Urine, Ulcers of the Neck of the Bladder, and the Scurvy. The Do≈øe is from ten to four and twenty Drops in ≈øome proper Liquor. The black Oyl is u≈øed to chafe the No≈øe and VVri≈øts of VVomen in hy≈øteric Fits. The volatile Salt of Ambar is a very good Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritive, and may be given from eight Grains to ≈øix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, in ≈øome opening Liquor, for the Jaundice, for I≈øchuries, Ulcers in the Bladder, the Scurvy, Fits of the Mother; and upon all Occa≈øions, where there is any need of removing Ob≈øtructions, and opening by way of Urine.</p>
               <p>Ambar-grea≈øe is a Bitumen found in many Places on the Sea Shore, but e≈øpecially in the <hi>Indies.</hi> It grows hard in the Sun-beams. The be≈øt is that which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gray and dry.</p>
               <p>VVhen it is wet, it appears blacki≈øh. Men have thought that it is found no where el≈øe but in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Seas, tho' ≈øome of it has been known to be found on the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Coa≈øt, and in ≈øeveral other Places in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> Mo≈øt of it is brought from the Coa≈øt of <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> Ambar-grea≈øe is an excellent Corroborative, it is given in ≈øome Liquor, or in an Electuary to increa≈øe Seed. The Do≈øe is from one Grain to four. The E≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of Ambar-Grea≈øe is an Extract of the more Oyly Parts of Ambar-grea≈øe, Musk, and Civet in Spirit of VVine.</p>
               <q>Take two Drams of good Ambar-grea≈øe, ≈øo much Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy, half a Dram of Musk, and two Grains of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet; beat them ≈ømall together, and put the Mixture into a Viol, pour upon it four Ounces of Wine well alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holized, ≈øtop the Viol clo≈øe, and ≈øet it in Dige≈øtion in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63575:133"/>Hor≈øe-Dung four Days; then taking it out, ≈øeparate that which is clear while it is warm; for it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal when cold. This E≈ø≈øence works more ≈øtrongly than Amber-grea≈øe in Sub≈øtance. The Do≈øe is from ≈øix to twelve Drops in ≈øome convenient Liquour.</q>
               <p>Ambar-grea≈øe alone has ≈øcarce any Smell at all, but when its Parts are put in Motion by Fermentation, Sulphurs ri≈øe from it, which tickle the Sen≈øe of Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with a great deal of Plea≈øure. The Addition of Musk and Civet have a good Effect. As for the Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy, it ≈øerves only to ≈øeparate the re≈øt, that they may be the more ea≈øily powdered, and di≈ø≈øolved; for this Tincture is only a Di≈ø≈øolution of the≈øe Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matters in Spirit of VVine.</p>
               <p>Metallic Recrements are ≈øo called, becau≈øe they are not perfect Metals, but participate of the Nature and Matter of Metals, and are ≈øeparated by Fermentation in the Generation of Meals, from other perfect Metals.</p>
               <p>Cobaltum is a Cau≈øtick, and is very volatile, and much mixed with a corro≈øive Ar≈øenick, and therefore is counted poy≈øonous. A Sky-colour is made of it. Some think a Medicine may be made of it for the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep≈øy; but the U≈øe of it is very dangerous, by rea≈øon of the Ar≈øenick.</p>
               <p>Chalcitis, Mi≈øy, and Sory are Metallick Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and belong to the Kinds of Vitriols, and may be properly called crude and impure Vitriol. Chalcitis is made of Sory, and Mi≈øy of Chalcitis. Mi≈øy is u≈øed for dying.</p>
               <p>Cadmia Factitia is nothing el≈øe but the Soot of Bra≈øs, which ≈øticks to the Furnace in the Fu≈øion of the Metal. It is chiefly u≈øed in Surgery, for old and ill conditioned Ulcers; for being ≈øprinkled upon them, it drys much, and de≈øtroys the corrupt Ferment of Ulcers, and ≈øo it incarns and cicatrizes. Cadmia being prepared by Fire, and extingui≈øhed, is called prepared Tutty, which is very good for Di≈øea≈øes of the Eyes, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63575:134"/>of it being blown into the Eyes, for Inflammations and Ulcers. An Oyntment is commonly made of it, and u≈øed for the Eyes: But it is very proper to mix with it a Grain or two of Camphor, or Saffron, or the like.</p>
               <p>Litharge is nothing el≈øe but the Lead, whereby Gold, in Fu≈øion, is depurated, which ab≈øorbs all the vile Metals, when the Gold is in Fu≈øion. There are two Sorts of Litharge, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gold and of Silver. The Litharge of Gold is the mo≈øt pure.</p>
               <p>Plumbago is the impure Mine of Lead.</p>
               <p>Pompholix is the fine≈øt Sparkles which ≈øticks to the uppermo≈øt Part of the Furnace in the Fu≈øion of Bra≈øs.</p>
               <p>Spodium is burnt Ivory.</p>
               <p>Pompholix is much u≈øed in Surgery, and is much commended for Di≈øea≈øes of the Eyes. The Oyntment called Diapompholigos is much commended for the Itch, and Pu≈øtles in the Skin; and al≈øo for Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Eyes.</p>
               <p>Sperma Caeti is vulgarly reckoned among≈øt Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, but it is certainly taken out of the Heads of Whales in <hi>Greenland.</hi> It is an excellent Remedy for di≈ø≈øolving coagulated Blood. It is u≈øed in Pleuri≈øies, Peripneumonia's, Brui≈øes, and the like, to take off In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, and the like. It is al≈øo excellent for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations and Swellings of the Papes, and for the Gripes in Children, and the Collick in grown People, being di≈ø≈øolved in ≈øome proper Water.

               <p>Petreolum is a Fat and bituminous Matter flowing by degrees from Rocks and Stones. Some think that Petreolum or Oyl of Peter is a Liquor drawn from Ambar, by the means of ≈øubterranean Fires, which make a De≈øtillation of it, and that Jet and Coals are the Remainders of it. This Opinion would have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability enough in it; if the Places from whence this Sort of Drug comes, were not ≈øo far a≈øunder, the one
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:63575:134"/>from the other; for Petreolum is not commonly found any where, but in <hi>Italy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Provence:</hi> It is excellent for Di≈øea≈øes of the Nerves, the Pal≈øy, and Convul≈øions, either alone or with Oyl of Ambar, and is excellent for cold Di≈øea≈øes of the Nerves. Ten or fifteen Drops of it being taken in Wine is a certain Cure for Ob≈øtructions of the Cour≈øes.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Metals are counted ≈øeven, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold, Silver, Iron, Tin, Copper, Lead, and Quick≈øilver. This la≈øt is not malleable of it ≈øelf, as all the others are, but is ≈øo being mingled with others. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe this is thought to be the Seed of Metals, it is numbred with the re≈øt. A≈øtrologers have conceited, that there was ≈øo great an Affinity and Corre≈øpondence between the ≈øeven Metals before named, and the ≈øeven Planets, that nothing happened to the one, but the other ≈øhared in it; and therefore they have given the≈øe ≈øeven Metals the Names of the ≈øeven Planets, each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they are governed, and ≈øo have called Gold the <hi>Sun,</hi> Silver the <hi>Moon,</hi> Iron, <hi>Mars,</hi> Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øilver <hi>Mercury,</hi> Tin <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Copper <hi>Venus,</hi> and Lead <hi>Saturn.</hi> They have likewi≈øe fancied that each of the≈øe Planets has his Day apart to di≈øtribute liberally his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øluence on our Hemi≈øphere, and ≈øo they tell us, if we work upon Silver on Monday, Iron on Tue≈øday, and ≈øo of the re≈øt, we ≈øhall attain our End much better than on other Days.</p>
               <p>As to Minerals, what≈øoever is found petrified in the Earth, or upon the Earth is called Mineral.</p>
               <p>Petrification is made by a Coagulation of acid or ≈øalt Waters that are found in the Pores of the Earth. This Petrification differs according to the divers Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions, or different Nature of the Earth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Time that Nature u≈øes in its Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <head>The Marrow of Chymi≈øtry.</head>
               <p>CHymi≈øtry, which comes from the Hebrew Word <hi>Chema,</hi> ≈øignifying an hot Star, is a contemplative and active Art: It examines all natural things; it teaches how to ≈øeparate the different Sub≈øtances, which are found in mixt Bodies. <hi>Tubal Cain,</hi> the eighth Man from <hi>Adam,</hi> was well skilled in Metallick Operations; and <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> calcined the Golden Calf of the Children of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and reduced it to a Powder. It is called the Hermetic Art, from the ancient <hi>Aegyptian Hermes,</hi> who was well skilled in Chymi≈øtty, and was one of the fir≈øt Inventors of it.</p>
               <p>As to the Principles of Chymi≈øtry, they are five; Water, Spirit, Oyl, Salt, and Earth; two are pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive, <hi>viz.</hi> Water and Earth; the re≈øt are active. But to pa≈øs by the≈øe things, we will treat only of ≈øuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as are mo≈øt u≈øed, and approved in Phy≈øick. Fir≈øt, we will ≈øet down tho≈øe Medicines that are made of Vitriol.</p>
               <p>To make the Oyl and Spirit of Vitriol, the Vitriol is calcined till it is yellow, that the accidental Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity may fly away, and then it is di≈øtilled in a Gla≈øs Retort, in the highe≈øt Degree of Fire for ≈øixty Hours, whereby the Spirit comes forth. At the Bottom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a very acid corro≈øive Spirit, which ≈øome call fal≈øly, the Oyl. This Di≈øtillation may be perfomed in a le≈øs Time, and to more Advantage, with a large Receiver that has a large Mouth, for ≈øo the Spirit will have a freer Pa≈ø≈øage. The honourable Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> makes his <hi>Ens Veneris</hi> with Colcothar of Vitriol, fir≈øt edulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with Rain Water, and afterwards ≈øublimed with a double Quantity of Sal Armoniac. This is a noble Medicine for the Rickets. The ≈øame Colcothar edulcorated, and reduced to a Catapla≈øm with the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:63575:195"/>White of an Egg, often cures Cancers of the Brea≈øts not ulcerated. Pour, Drop by Drop, the corro≈øive Spirit into Rain Water impregnated with Vitriol, and evaporate it half away, and you'll ≈øee Streaks like Hairs; pour the ani≈øated Bal≈øom of Sulphur into the ≈øaid Water, and you will find a red Ma≈øs like Soap. If you take Vitriol of Steel, with a double Quantity of Sal Armoniack, and proceed in the ≈øame Method, you'll have a Sublimate in Ta≈øte and Smell like <hi>Ens Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris.</hi> The Styptic Water is a Solution of Vitriol and other Ingredients.</p>
               <p>Take of Colcothar of red Vitriol, that remains in the Retort, after the Spirit is drawn out, burnt Allom and Sugarcandy, each half a Dram; the Urine of a young Per≈øon, and Ro≈øe Water, each half an Ounce; Plantain Water, two Ounces; ≈øtir them all together a good while in a Mortar, then pour the Mixture into a Viol, and when you u≈øe it, ≈øeparate it by Inclination. This ≈øtyptick Liquor ≈øtops Arterial Blood without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriation. Apply a Rag dipt in it, and hold it a while to the Part.</p>
               <p>Some di≈øtil Vitriol of <hi>Mars</hi> for a Spirit, and count it a great Secret: But it is nothing el≈øe but Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol regenerated. Tartar vitriolated is vulgarly made by dropping Spirit of Vitriol upon Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> till it is perfectly ≈øaturated, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they dry it, then they di≈ø≈øolve it in Rain Water, filtrate and evaporate it, and again gently dry it for U≈øe: But the following way of preparing it is much better.</p>
               <p>Take green Vitriol, di≈ø≈øolve it in Rain Water, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dige≈øt, and filtrate, then by hot Iron Plates, wholly ≈øeparate the Particles of Copper from it, then filtrate it again, and drop upon it a ≈øufficient Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit of Sal Armoniac, or Harts-horn; dige≈øt and filtrate it, and repeat the Operation till no Filth remains at the Bottom, then evaporate it till it
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63575:196"/>is dry, keep it for U≈øe. The Do≈øe is one Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol calcined, and Niter, each one Pound; of common Salt, two Pound; and of Quick Lime, half a Pound, is made Aqua Fortis, by Di≈øtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. The common way of making Aqua Fortis, is with Colcothar of Vitriol, and Niter; but I ≈øuppo≈øe this is Spirit of Niter; therefore take Vitriol calcined till it is yellow, and of Niter, each equal Parts; put them both into a Gla≈øs Retort, and having luted on the Receiver, keep up a ≈øtrong Fire, as long as any Vapours appear in the Receiver. If you add Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, the Aqua Fortis will become Aqua Regia, which is much u≈øed about Metals. Take the Caput Mortuum of Aqua Fortis, and with Rain Water ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a Salt; filtrate, and cri≈øtalize it, then grind it upon a Stone, and afterwards put the Salt into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, and pour upon it the fore≈øaid Aqua Fortis; di≈øtil, and cohobate it till the whole comes over into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and you'll have a Noctiluca like Fire. The ≈øame way is made the ≈øhining Salt, wherewith the Beard being moi≈øtened, appears in the Dark like Fire, by the Addition of a fine Spirit, which few know, made of one Part of Niter, and three Parts of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Bole, which you mu≈øt afterwards rectifie, and keep for U≈øe. The Salt extracted by the Rain Water from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Mortuum, is nothing el≈øe but Niter, tho' ≈øome think it is an Alcali: So thought Dr. <hi>Mayow,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, in his Treati≈øe of Niter, that the Caput Mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of di≈øtilled Niter, is very like an Alcali Salt.</p>
               <p>Among all the Salts, I think common Salt is the mo≈øt excellent; this is peculiar in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and makes a Noi≈øe when we endeavour to free it from its accidental Moi≈øture.
